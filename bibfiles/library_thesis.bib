abstract = {Abstract Biological impacts of climate change are exemplified by shifts in phenology. As the timing of breeding advances, the within-season relationships between timing of breeding and reproductive traits may change and cause long-term changes in the population mean value of reproductive traits. We investigated long-term changes in the timing of breeding and within-season patterns of clutch size, egg volume, incubation duration, and daily nest survival of three shorebird species between two decades. Based on previously known within-season patterns and assuming a warming trend, we hypothesized that the timing of clutch initiation would advance between decades and would be coupled with increases in mean clutch size, egg volume, and daily nest survival rate. We monitored 1,378 nests of western sandpipers, semipalmated sandpipers, and red-necked phalaropes at a subarctic site during 1993–1996 and 2010–2014. Sandpipers have biparental incubation, whereas phalaropes have uniparental incubation. We found an unexpected long-term cooling trend during the early part of the breeding season. Three species delayed clutch initiation by 5 days in the 2010s relative to the 1990s. Clutch size and daily nest survival showed strong within-season declines in sandpipers, but not in phalaropes. Egg volume showed strong within-season declines in one species of sandpiper, but increased in phalaropes. Despite the within-season patterns in traits and shifts in phenology, clutch size, egg volume, and daily nest survival were similar between decades. In contrast, incubation duration did not show within-season variation, but decreased by 2 days in sandpipers and increased by 2 days in phalaropes. Shorebirds demonstrated variable breeding phenology and incubation duration in relation to climate cooling, but little change in nonphenological components of traits. Our results indicate that the breeding phenology of shorebirds is closely associated with the temperature conditions on breeding ground, the effects of which can vary among reproductive traits and among sympatric species.},

abstract = {Abstract After an absence of more than two decades, Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) resumed nesting in Ontario in 1986. Between 1991 and 2006, at least 193 young fledged in southern Ontario and 548 young fledged in northern Ontario. The number of breeding pairs, nesting attempts, successful nests, and young fledged all steadily increased in both regions throughout this period. In southern Ontario, 25{\%} of the breeding adults produced nearly 50{\%} of all fledglings, and 87{\%} of the fledglings came from just eight breeding sites. Direction of natal dispersal was variable, but females consistently moved farther than males, and there was frequent movement both to and from adjacent American states. The population recovery resulted from the release of 592 captive-bred F. p. anatum juveniles in Ontario between 1977 and 2005, plus immigration from other provinces and release efforts in adjacent regions of the United States, where at least five subspecies contributed to the gene pool of captive-bred birds.

abstract = {Predation appears to be the single most important biotic factor regulating populations of bivalves in estuarine and coastal soft sediments. However, the relative roles of predation and intraspecific competition are rarely investigated simultaneously over different spatial scales, making generalities about these mechanisms difficult. Using juveniles of the soft-shell clam, Mya arenaria (initial mean shell length [SL] +/- 95{\%} CI = 12.4 +/- 0.13 mm), I tested the interactive effects of predator deterrence and intraspecific density (660 vs. 1320 individuals m(-2)) on growth and survival responses over a 185-day period from May to November 2003 at spatial scales that spanned four orders of magnitude: embayments, sites within embayments, tidal gradients, and blocks that were 10,000's, 1000's, 100's, and 5 m apart, respectively. Replicate field experiments were conducted from May to November 2003 at the upper and lower tidal heights at each of two intertidal mud flats (sites) within each of two embayments (Passamaquoddy Bay [PB] and Cobscook Bay [CB]) in eastern Maine. Mean survival, relative growth, and the abundance of wild recruits each varied significantly over all spatial scales. Predation was the most important factor affecting clam survival, explaining 45{\%} of the total variability, whereas embayment, sites within embayments, tidal gradient, and intraspecific density collectively accounted for less than 10{\%} of the variation. At all four intertidal sites, clam survival in experimental units designed to deter predators averaged 72{\%}, but the degree of enhancement varied between embayments (PB = 6 1 {\%}; CB = 267{\%}). Average survival rate was higher (by 12-16{\%}), but growth was slower (by ca. 50{\%}) in upper vs. lower intertidal blocks; however, the patterns differed for both variables between sites within each embayment. The effect of increasing intraspecific clam density was to lower survival by ca. 17{\%} (56{\%} [660 m(-2)] vs. 48{\%} [1320 m(-2)]) in both embayments, but growth was unaffected. Overall, clams doubled in SL, although mean relative growth was 15{\%} greater in CB than PB. Tidal gradient, sites within embayments, and blocks were the three most important factors explaining 35{\%}, 19{\%}, and 22{\%} of total variation in relative clam growth, respectively. In Maine and the northeast US, juveniles of Mya reach their highest abundance above mean low tide levels. Experimental evidence presented here suggests that differential predation along the tidal gradient is the dominant factor controlling clam abundance and distribution patterns in the intertidal zone.

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. How group size affects predator attack and success rate, and so prey vulnerability, is important in determining the nonlethal consequences of predation risk on animal populations and communities. Theory predicts that both predator attack success rate and the dilution effect decline exponentially with group size and that selection generates optimal group sizes at a 'risk threshold' above which antipredation benefits are outweighed by costs, such as those owing to higher attack rates. 2. We examined whether flock size risk thresholds for attack rate, success rate or dilution differed, and therefore whether the strength of selection for group size differed for these three factors, using a system of redshank Tringa totanus flocks being hunted by Eurasian sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus. We also asked which of the three thresholds, on their own or in combination, predicted the most commonly observed group size. 3. Mean redshank flock size increased with a very gradual quadratic function (i.e. approximately linearly) with population size, although at a rate half that possible; when population size was not limiting, individuals almost always avoided flocks of less than 30 and birds were frequently in flocks up to at least 80. Sparrowhawk attack rate showed a quadratic relationship with flock size and peaked at 55 redshanks. Sparrowhawk attack success rate, however, declined exponentially, becoming less steep at flock sizes of about 40 and remaining uniformly low (a 95{\%} decrease) by 70. Combined with dilution, individual risk of death per attack decreased by 95{\%} when group size reached 30 (20 for the dilution effect alone). 4. Redshanks most commonly formed group sizes that gained the maximum individual predation risk reduction. They also commonly formed group sizes far above any further substantial advantages from the dilution effect or from reducing attack rate, but that continued to reduce predation risk by lowering attack success rate. Individuals did not always form the largest groups possible which we suggest is because individual variation in risk-taking subdivides the population. This places a constraint on the ability of individuals to compensate for predation risk and will have a variety of important effects on animal populations.},

Availability of habitat was variable within and between seasons, but fluctuations in habitat were dampened when wetlands were considered as a complex rather than individually. Shorebirds exhibited an ability to colonize available habitat opportunistically, to occupy wet mud/shallow water habitats that became available during their residency period regardless of wetland history, and to use wet mud/shallow water habitat almost immediately upon its appearance. We found a significant relation between number of shorebirds and the area of wet med/shallow water habitat, regardless of dramatic changes in habitat. Management for continental stop-over sites for shorebirds requires the maintenance of complexes of potential habitat to assure resource alternatives for birds as local conditions vacillate.},

abstract = {Ecological research uses data collection techniques that are prone to substantial and unique types of measurement error to address scientific questions about species abundance and distribution. These data collection schemes include a number of survey methods in which unmarked individuals are counted, or determined to be present, at spatially-referenced sites. Examples include site occupancy sampling, repeated counts, distance sampling, removal sampling, and double observer sampling. To appropriately analyze these data, hierarchical models have been developed to separately model explanatory variables of both a latent abundance or occurrence process and a conditional detection process. Because these models have a straightforward interpretation paralleling mechanisms under which the data arose, they have recently gained immense popularity. The common hierarchical structure of these models is well-suited for a unified modeling interface. The R package unmarked provides such a unified modeling framework, including tools for data exploration, model fitting, model criticism, post-hoc analysis, and model comparison.},

abstract = {Catastrophic and sudden collapses of ecosystems are sometimes preceded by early warning signals that potentially could be used to predict and prevent a forthcoming catastrophe. Universality of these early warning signals has been proposed, but no formal proof has been provided. Here, we show that in relatively simple ecological models the most commonly used early warning signals for a catastrophic collapse can be silent. We underpin the mathematical reason for this phenomenon, which involves the direction of the eigenvectors of the system. Our results demonstrate that claims on the universality of early warning signals are not correct, and that catastrophic collapses can occur without prior warning. In order to correctly predict a collapse and determine whether early warning signals precede the collapse, detailed knowledge of the mathematical structure of the approaching bifurcation is necessary. Unfortunately, such knowledge is often only obtained after the collapse has already occurred.},

abstract = {The distribution of migratory shorebirds within Delaware Bay, New Jersey, was examined relative to prey abundance and the physical characteristics of the intertidal beaches. Red Knots (Calidris canutus), Sanderlings (C. alba), Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres), and ''peeps'' comprised nearly 100{\%} of the shorebirds on seven study beaches from mid-May to early June in both 1990 and 1991. The most abundant food item on these beaches was horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) eggs, and there were few other available macroinvertebrates. Beaches preferred by shorebirds had higher numbers of crab eggs; the density of eggs in some surface (0-5 cm) sediments exceeded 10(5)/m2. In general, both horseshoe crab eggs and shorebirds increased along the bay shore from Higbee's Beach (near Cape May Point) to Moore's Beach, 32 km up-bay. However, shorebirds were widely distributed within the bay, possibly because eggs were sufficiently abundant on most beaches to support foraging by at least four birds per meter of shoreline. Shorebirds aggregated near shoreline discontinuities, such as salt-marsh creeks and jetties, that acted as concentrating mechanisms for passively drifting eggs. Sediment grain size and heterogeneity were probably not a primary determinant of shorebird distribution within Delaware Bay. Intertidal sand flats were not extensively used by foraging shorebirds, but the potential importance of nearby salt marshes as foraging sites requires further investigation.},

abstract = {We investigated prey responses to multiple predators by observing drift and positioning of Baetis bicaudatus (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae) nymphs in the presence of non-feeding brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis chemical cues) and predatory stoneflies (Megarcys signata with glued mouths), In experiments carried out in stream-side channels Baetis antipredator behaviour differed markedly in response to each predator separately; they drifted away from stoneflies, and reduced exposure and drift levels in the presence of trout odour. When both predator cues were presented together the effect of stoneflies, which were observed more frequently at night, depended on the time of day and was modified by presence of fish odour. During the day Baetis responses to both predators were hierarchical as drift and the number on stone tops was reduced whenever fish odour was present regardless of the presence of stoneflies. At night when stoneflies were foraging, Baetis behaviour reflected a compromise between avoiding both predators, with responses to both predators being intermediate between that characteristic of stonefly avoidance (entering the drift) and that characteristic of fish avoidance (drift avoidance). The switch in antipredator behaviour from 'hierarchy' to 'compromise' between multiple predators reflects changes in the relative risk of predation during the day and night. During the day visually feeding trout present a higher predation risk, but at night when stoneflies are foraging and trout visual systems are less effective, the predation risks become more similar. We found no evidence for 'accumulative' avoidance where the magnitude of avoidance increases in response to the number of predators present, because avoiding stoneflies conflicted with avoiding trout, We predict that predator avoidance will take place in the form of a 'hierarchy' when one predator presents substantially higher predation risk, than another 'compromise' behaviour will be observed when the pi predation risk presented by two predators is more equivalent. but avoiding one predator conflicts with avoiding another; and 'accumulative antipredatory responses will be observed only when responses to different predators do not conflict. We emphasise that investigation of the responses of prey to multiple predators is important to our understanding of natural communities, and is likely to reveal details about the mechanisms determining the outcome of interactions involving multiple predators.},

Spring migrants had 22{\%} higher total and 67{\%} higher standardized pancreatic lipase activities but 37{\%} lower total pancreatic amylase activity than fall migrants, which suggests that the spring diet was enriched with lipids but low in glycogen.

While there is an expected negative relationship between population trend and FID in Australia and Europe, we found the inverse relationship for North American birds; thus FID cannot be used as a universal predictor of vulnerability of birds. However, the analysis of the joint explanatory ability of multiple drivers (farmland breeding habitat, pole-most breeding latitude, migratory habit, FID) effects on population status replicated previously reported strong effects of farmland breeding habitat (an effect apparently driven mostly by European birds), as well as strong effects of FID, body size, migratory habit and continent.

abstract = {ABSTRACT The alternative prey hypothesis (APH) suggests that the functional and numerical response of predators to fluctuating rodent populations may drive annual variation in predation pressure on other available prey such as bird eggs. Most studies that have provided evidence supporting the APH in arctic bird populations have been conducted in the eastern hemisphere, and considerably less evidence for APH has emerged from western hemisphere populations. We tested the hypothesis that predation pressure on shorebird nests would increase as lemming abundance decreases due to apparent competition between lemmings and shorebirds via their shared predators in the eastern Canadian High Arctic. Over a period of 5 years on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada, we found that lemming abundance had a significant negative effect on predation risk asmeasured by artificial nests. Survival probabilities of artificial nests were also negatively related to fox abundance but positively associated with the abundance of breeding avian predators, likely due to predator exclusion around avian predator nests. Models of daily nest survival for real nests also indicated that interannual variation in nest survival was best explained by lemming abundance. Combined results from both artificial and real nests indicate that fluctuations in lemming populations likely have an indirect effect on predation pressure on shorebird eggs in the Canadian High Arctic, although mechanisms explaining the observed relationship require further investigation.},

abstract = {When birds are attacked by predators, initial take-off is crucial for survival. Theoretical studies have predicted that predation risk in terms of impaired flight ability increases with body weight. However, studies in which attacks were simulated, and within-individual daily changes in body weight were used to test mass-dependent take-off outside migration period, have so far failed to show an effect of mass on velocity. In this field study I compared the mass/velocity relationships of alarmed adult male and juvenile female great tits, Parus major. Fattening strategies differ among members of the dominance-structured basic flocks of wintering great tits, and dominant individuals often carry significantly less amount of fat reserves than subordinates. Since the range of body weight gain/loss is the least among dominant males, it was expected that impaired flight ability is more likely in lower-ranked female great tits. The results show that the birds differed significantly in their daily increase of relative body weight. Average daily weight increase of adult males was 6.2{\%}, while it was 12.2{\%} in juvenile females. Males were faster than females at take-off both at dawn and at dusk. Flight velocity of males did not differ significantly between dawn and dusk, whereas females took off at a significantly lower speed at dusk than at dawn. The results suggest that the larger fat reserves of subordinate females needed to increase their chances of overwinter survival probably place them at increased risk of predation.},

migration to a post-migration moult in the wintering area. Different
adaptations for efficient migration are also discussed. Finally, I use a

abstract = {Interactions between invasive species and native fauna afford a unique opportunity to examine interspecific encounters as they first occur, without the complications introduced by coevolution. In northern Australia, the continuing invasion of the highly toxic cane toad Bufo marinus poses a threat to many frog-eating predators. Can predators learn to distinguish the novel toxic prey item from native prey (and thus, avoid being poisoned), or are longer-term genetically based changes to attack behaviour needed before predators can coexist with toads? To predict the short-term impact of cane toads on native predators, we need to know the proportion of individuals that will attack toads, the proportion surviving the encounter, and whether surviving predators learn to avoid toads. We quantified these traits in a dasyurid (common planigale, Planigale maculata) that inhabits tropical floodplains across northern Australia. Although 90{\%} of naive planigales attacked cane toads, 83{\%} of these animals survived because they either rejected the toad unharmed, or killed and consumed the prey snout-first (thereby avoiding the toxin-laden parotoid glands). Most planigales showed one-trial learning and subsequently refused to attack cane toads for long time periods (up to 28 days). Toad-exposed planigales also avoided native frogs for up to 9 days, thereby providing an immediate benefit to native anurans. However, the predators gradually learnt to use chemical cues to discriminate between frogs and toads. Collectively, our results suggest that generalist predators can learn to distinguish and avoid novel toxic prey very rapidly - and hence, that small dasyurid predators can rapidly adapt to the cane toad invasion. Indeed, it may be feasible to teach especially vulnerable predators to avoid cane toads before the toads invade, by deploying low-toxicity baits that stimulate taste-aversion learning.},

abstract = {Coastal landscapes with extensive intertidal mudflats provide non-breeding habitat for Arctic shorebirds. Few attempts have been made to develop and test landscape-level models predicting the intertidal distribution of these birds. We modelled the distribution of a Holarctic species, Dunlin (Calidris alpina), at a hemispherically important non-breeding site, the Fraser River Delta, British Columbia, Canada, in seasons with different predator landscapes. We trained the models during a season when nocturnal predators were common and tested temporal transferability of the models on independent datasets when nocturnal predators were absent. Snowy Owls (Nyctea scandiaca) influenced Dunlin distribution and thus model transferability. After accounting for their presence, models displayed good to excellent discrimination, i.e. prediction of the instantaneous and cumulative (over low tide period) probability of mudflat use by Dunlin, in fore- and backcasting applications. Model calibration was good or else, where over-prediction was observed, the reason for the bias was identified. The distribution models may predict mudflat use by Dunlin and possibly related species given relevant data describing the intertidal landscape. The models are amenable to GIS application, describe the amount of use per hectare of the intertidal zone and can be used to determine and visualise relative and absolute suitability of intertidal areas.},

abstract = {Wetland stopover use by migratory shorebirds is concurrently influenced by habitat characteristics within a stopover site and characteristics related to the broader context surrounding the stopover site. To conserve wetland habitats essential for shorebird migration through the interior of North America, we need to understand how these dual scales influence stopover use. We surveyed over14,000 wetlands within 10 broad-scale landscapes in north-central Oklahoma from 2007 through 2009 to determine how characteristics within (intra) and surrounding (context) wetlands influence the density and species richness of migrating shorebirds at stopover sites. We used zero-inflated modeling and an information theoretic framework to separately examine and then compare the relative importance of intra-habitat variables and habitat context variables in explaining use of stopovers. We observed 38,288 migratory shorebirds of 29 species. Shorebirds were least likely to occur in isolated, small, steep-sided wetland habitats. Among intra-patch variables, shorebird density and richness were best explained by wetland habitat area, slope, and the cover and height of vegetation within a wetland. Shorebird density and richness were more than 2 times higher in large wetland habitats (i.e. .3.3 ha), and both decreased with increased vegetation and slope. The density of wetlands within 1.5 km of a stopover site had the greatest impact on shorebird density and richness among patch context variables. As habitat density increased from 0.07 to 1, shorebird abundance and richness increased by .200{\%}. Shorebirds were positively related to grazing pressure but negatively related to forest/shrubland, urban/suburban development, and grassland land cover contexts. When compared to models with intra-habitat variables, models containing habitat context variables better explained migratory shorebird density and richness. We conclude that characteristics related to the broader context surrounding a wetland stopover sites strongly influence stopover use by migratory shorebirds. Conservation and management of shorebirds migrating through the continental interior should aim to provide large expanses of sparsely vegetated and shallow habitats within stopover sites and focus on open landscapes that contain high densities of stopover habitats.},

abstract = {Evidence-based protection of migratory birds at flyway levels requires a solid understanding of their use of ‘stopping sites' during migration. To characterize the site use of northward-migration great knots Calidris tenuirostris in China, we compared length of stay and fuel deposition during northward migration at areas in the south and the north of the Yellow Sea, a region critical for migrating shorebirds. Radio-tracking showed that at the southern site great knots stayed for only short periods (2.3 ± 1.9 d, n = 40), and bird captures showed that they did not increase their mean body mass while there. In the north birds stayed for 1 month (31.0 ± 13.6 d, n = 22) and almost doubled their mean body mass. Fuel consumption models suggest that great knots departing from the northern Yellow Sea should be able to fly nonstop to the breeding grounds, whereas those from the south would require a refueling stop further north. These results indicate that the study sites in the northern and southern Yellow Sea serve different roles: the southern site acts as a temporary stopover area that enables birds with low fuel stores to make it to main staging areas further north, while the northern site serves as the critical staging site where birds refuel for the next leg of their migration. The rapid turnover rate in the southern Yellow Sea indicates that many more birds use that area than are indicated by peak counts. Differential use of the southern and northern sites indicates that both play crucial roles in the ability of great knots to migrate successfully.},

abstract = {Nemertines can be important predators on tidal flats. They have been found to be preferentially active at night low tides. To understand the role of these (and other) predators, it is important to understand how they find their prey on tidal flats. Field observations revealed that the nemertine Lineus viridis feeds on post-spawn Nereis virens in the spring. Field experiments demonstrated that the placement of post-spawn or freeze-thawed N, virens on tidal flats can elicit a foraging response of L. viridis. Nemertines came to the sediment surface in large numbers and crawled toward the prey. Comparative experiments showed that more nemertines were attracted to the sediment surface at day low tides than at day high tides. More nemertines were attracted at night low tides than at day low tides. Numbers of active nemertines on tidal flat areas without prey were always much lower than on tidal flat areas with prey. In an experimental flume in the laboratory, starved nemertines were attracted to prey at current velocities of about 2 cm s(-1). Regardless of whether it was a simulated high tide or low tide in the flume, successful nemertines required about 30 min to cover a distance of 50 cm between the starting point and the prey. It is concluded that the high activity of nemertines during night low tides is due in part to the enhanced probability of locating prey, but is also influenced by prey behavior and potential competitors. Predatory nemertines such as L. viridis easily cover relatively large distances of 5-10 m in the field, and may thus effectively influence the small-scale distribution of their potential prey on tidal flats. It is proposed to take the activity pattern, mobility and foraging range of predators into account when examining their role in marine soft-bottom assemblages.},

abstract = {Plasma metabolites, including triglycerides, beta -hydroxybutyrate, and glycerol, can be used to estimate mass change in birds. Although dietary fatty acids can be ingested and absorbed as phospholipids, they have been largely overlooked as a potential indicator of mass change. The plasma ratio of triglyceride to phospholipid could also provide insight into diet quality because a high ratio in food items indicates high relative energy content. Variability in dietary phospholipid content and triglyceride : phospholipid may also affect the relationships between metabolites and mass change. We fed Gambel's white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii) diets differing in phospholipid content and triglyceride : phospholipid and measured metabolites during mass loss and mass gain. Plasma phospholipids were higher and triglyceride : phospholipid was lower in birds fed a diet higher in phospholipid content and lower in triglyceride : phospholipid. Contrary to our expectations, plasma phospholipids were negatively related to mass change. Plasma triglyceride levels were positively related to mass change and unaffected by diet. The relationships between mass change and both plasma beta -hydroxybutyrate and glycerol were affected by diet. Plasma triglyceride appears to be the most reliable metabolite predicting body mass changes, but inclusion of plasma phospholipids and triglyceride : phospholipid into metabolite profiles may provide additional information on diet quality.},

abstract = {Phenological responses to climate change differ across trophic levels, which may lead to birds failing to breed at the time of maximal food abundance. Here we investigate the population consequences of such mistiming in the migratory pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca. In a comparison of nine Dutch populations, we find that populations have declined by about 90{\%} over the past two decades in areas where the food for provisioning nestlings peaks early in the season and the birds are currently mistimed. In areas with a late food peak, early-breeding birds still breed at the right time, and there is, at most, a weak population decline. If food phenology advances further, we also predict population declines in areas with a late food peak, as in these areas adjustment to an advanced food peak is insufficient. Mistiming as a result of climate change is probably a widespread phenomenon, and here we provide evidence that it can lead to population declines.},

abstract = {Regime shifts are substantial, long-lasting reorganizations of complex systems, such as ecosystems. Large ecosystem changes such as eutrophication, shifts among vegetation types, degradation of coral reefs and regional climate change often come as surprises because we lack leading indicators for regime shifts. Increases in variability of ecosystems have been suggested to foreshadow ecological regime shifts. However, it may be difficult to discern variability due to impending regime shift from that of exogenous drivers that affect the ecosystem. We addressed this problem using a model of lake eutrophication. Lakes are subject to fluctuations in recycling associated with regime shifts, as well as fluctuating nutrient inputs. Despite the complications of noisy inputs, increasing variability of lake-water phosphorus was discernible prior to the shift to eutrophic conditions. Simulations show that rising standard deviation (SD) could signal impending shifts about a decade in advance. The rising SD was detected by studying variability around predictions of a simple time-series model, and did not depend on detailed knowledge of the actual ecosystem dynamics.},

abstract = {The Fraser River Delta in British Columbia, Canada, is a globally significant stopover site for shorebirds, but the population status and trends of many species that use the site remain uncertain. We describe an ongoing program to monitor population trends of the two most abundant species, Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) and Dunlins (Calidris alpina), during northward migration. Counts of these species were conducted at a mudflat where large flocks assembled at mid-tide from 15 April to 15 May, 1991–2013, and we estimated species-specific counts as the product of daily total flock counts and species proportions obtained during supplementary sampling. The median peak count of both species combined was 177,000 birds, and occurred between 24 April and 3 May. Ratios (proportions) of the two species followed a predictable pattern during the migration period, with a low proportion of Western Sandpipers (3{\%}–20{\%}) in flocks before 20 April, followed by a rapid increase to 80{\%}–100{\%} between 25 April and 10 May and a variable decrease to 30{\%}–80{\%} by 15 May. Mean counts of Western Sandpipers showed no significant trend over the study period. Mean counts of Dunlins showed a non-linear trend, decreasing until 2001 and then increasing to 2013. Bias and random error in field counts were quantified by comparing field counts to counts made from photographs taken during surveys, and analysis revealed that field counts had a downward, but predictable, bias, accounting for {\textgreater}90{\%} of birds present, with a stochastic error rate of 28.0{\%}. Uncertainty in total population estimates was high after accounting for the effect of length of stay and sampling error. Population estimates suggested that 600,000 Western Sandpipers and 200,000 Dunlins typically passed through the site during northward migration. Our estimates indicate the usefulness of daily counts at major stopover sites during northward migration as an effective tool for monitoring shorebird populations, and underscore the need for conserving such sites.},

abstract = {In migratory species, sexual size dimorphism can mean differing energetic requirements for males and females. Differences in the costs of migration and in the environmental conditions occurring throughout the range may therefore result in sex-biases in distribution and resource use at different spatial scales. In order to identify the scale at which sexual segregation operates, and thus the scale at which environmental changes may have sex-biased impacts, we use range-wide tracking of individually color-ringed Icelandic black-tailed godwits (Limosa limosa islandica) to quantify sexual segregation at scales ranging from the occupation of sites throughout the non-breeding range to within-site differences in distribution and resource use. Throughout the range of this migratory shorebird, there is no evidence of large-scale sex differences in distribution during the non-breeding season. However, the sexes differ in their selection of prey types and sizes, which results in small-scale sexual segregation within estuaries. The scale of sexual segregation therefore depends on the scale of variation in resource distribution, which, in this system, is primarily within estuaries. Sexual segregation in within-site distribution and resource use means that local-scale anthropogenic impacts on estuarine benthic prey communities may disproportionately affect the sexes in these migratory shorebirds.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine whether experimental artifacts have the potential to bias comparisons of relative predation intensity among different soft-sediment estuarine habitats. A field experiment was used to test (1) whether predation intensity on the infaunal clam Mercenaria mercenaria (L.) differed between shallow-subtidal and intertidal sand flats, (2) whether predation on clams differed between intertidal sand flats and vegetated habitats [the edge of Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) salt marshes] of similar elevation, and (3) whether the outcome of these comparisons was influenced by the experimental method used. For mobile prey, some restraint on prey movement is typically required to compare predation intensity among different habitats. This is most often achieved by tethering prey. Tethering and other experimental interventions may induce different experimental artifacts in estimates of predation intensity in different habitats, which would invalidate between-habitat comparisons (Peterson {\&} Black 1994: Mar Ecol Frog Ser 111:289-297). I used combinations of 2 types of prey restraint, tethers and buried fences, to test for possible interactive effects of habitat and prey restraint on prey mortality. Tethered or untethered clams were deployed within fenced or unfenced field plots within each habitat type, in a factorial design, and were exposed to the natural assemblage of predators for 1 wk. Within each habitat type, both tethering and fencing increased the proportion of clams recovered Live after 1 wk compared to the treatment in which no prey restraints were used. Significantly more Live clams were recovered in the intertidal sand flats than in the subtidal sand bottoms within field plots enclosed with buried fences, suggesting lower predation intensity in the intertidal than in subtidal sand fiats. In contrast, there was no significant difference in proportions of live clams between subtidal sand bottoms and intertidal sand flats within unfenced plots. These results were obtained with both tethered and untethered clams. Significantly more clams were recovered live in intertidal sand flats than in intertidal salt marshes of similar elevation in all treatment combinations, suggesting lower predation intensity in unvegetated than in vegetated habitats. This result was unexpected because habitat structural complexity is known to decrease predation rates in other shallow marine habitats, such as rocky intertidal habitats and seagrass beds. Results of this field experiment indicate that prey restraints can bias not only estimates of predation intensity within a single habitat type but can also bias between-habitat comparisons of predation intensity, probably by causing experimental artifacts of different magnitudes in each habitat. The actual magnitude of experimental artifacts in each habitat type can only be estimated with direct observations of predator-prey interactions in the field.},

Most studies of stopover areas have focused on wetlands in the Northern Great Plains; little attention has been given to wetlands in the Southern Great Plains, especially the Playa Lakes Region (PLR). Our objectives were to determine migrant-shorebird species compositions, abundances, migration chronologies, use of habitats, and feeding ecologies in the PLR during spring and fall migration. More than 130 playa wetlands were surveyed for shorebirds in a 34,000-km(2) area of western Texas. We selected American avocet (Recurvirostra americana), long-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus scolopaceus), least sandpiper (Calidris minutilla), and western sandpiper (C. mauri) as a subset of all shorebirds present to examine feeding ecologies; these 4 species were common species during both migration periods and represent a wide range of body sizes and guilds. We also evaluated the influence of sex on the feeding ecologies of the 4 species. Thirty shorebird species used playa wetlands during spring and fall, 1993-94. The most abundant species during spring were American avocet, long-billed dowitcher, and Wilson's phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor), whereas the most abundant species during fall were American avocet, long-billed dowitcher, long-billed curlew (Numenius americanus), stilt sandpiper (Calidris himantopus), and lesser yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes). Migration chronologies of each species were distinct in spring with peak abundances occurring over 2-4 weeks and were protracted in fall with peak abundances occurring over 5-8 weeks. In general, most shorebird species selected playas that contained sparse vegetation ({\textless}25{\%} vegetation cover), adequate amounts of mudflat (10-15{\%}) and shallow ({\textless}4 cm depth) water (10-20{\%}) habitats, and higher invertebrate populations. Invertebrates were the most important component in the diets of American avocets, long-billed dowitchers, least sandpipers, and western sandpipers, and diets varied little between males and females. In the spring, all 4 species consumed mostly chironomids, whereas in the fall, all 4 consumed a wider variety of invertebrates. Important invertebrate foods during the fall included chironomids, hydrophilids, leeches, planorbids, corixids, conchostracans, and hydracarinas. The 4 species also consumed more plant material (predominantly seeds) in the fall than in the spring. Differences in spring and fall diets of the 4 shorebird species were attributed to seasonal differences in invertebrate abundances and diversities; invertebrate abundances and diversities were higher in the fall than in the spring. Shorebird diets were compared with availabilities of foods within and across individual playas. For most foods, overall selection patterns (i.e., selection across playas) were different from selection patterns within individual playas. In general, all 4 species exhibited a nide range of selection patterns for invertebrates as availability of invertebrates changed, suggesting that the 4 species used an opportunistic foraging strategy. Shorebird foraging appeared to decrease invertebrate populations in spring, but not in fall. Management of playas in the PLR should focus on creating and maintaining sparse vegetation cover, and adequate mudflat (at least 10-15{\%}) and shallow water (at least 10-20{\%}) habitats. Because invertebrates are important foods of migrant shorebirds, management also should focus on enhancing invertebrate populations in playas. Gradual drawdowns of playas with deep water and flooding of dry playas should be used to provide available habitat for shorebirds throughout migration. Mowing and shallow disking can be used to create preferred habitat conditions and provide a detrital food base to enhance invertebrate populations. Managers that can manage only a few playas should consider managing playas during periods of maximum shorebird diversity in the PLR. During spring, maximum shorebird diversity occurred in late April and early May, whe eas during fall, maximum shorebird diversity occurred in late August.},

abstract = {Despite years of effort from behavioral ecologists, animal behavior has not been fully integrated into the field of conservation biology. We propose a novel framework to join these fields through the use of demographic models. We present three strategies for incorporating behavior in demographic models, outline the costs of each strategy through decision analysis, and build on previous work in behavioral ecology and demography. We then provide practical recommendations for applying this framework to management programs. First, relevant behavioral mechanisms should be included in demographic models used for conservation decision making. Second, rapid behavioral as- sessment is a useful tool to approximate demographic parameters through regression of demographic phenomena on observations of related behaviors. Behaviorally estimated parameters may be included in population viability analysis for use in management. Finally, behavioral indices can be used as indicators of population trends. Rapid behavioral assessment holds promise as a cost-effective tool, but also represents a cost to model accuracy. We provide a framework for implementing rapid behavioral assessment through case stud- ies of reproductive, foraging, and antipredator behaviors. We use a decision- theoretic approach to provide quantitative rules for identifying when met- rics of animal behavior may be more meaningful than traditional population assessment.},

abstract = {The distance separating predator and prey when the predator begins to approach, starting distance, was re- cently shown to affect flight initiation distance in many bird species, raising questions about the effect's generality, variation with ecological factors, and economic basis. I studied the effect in two lizard species that forage by ambush and escape into nearby refuges. Monitoring costs during approach are absent because ambushers remain immobile while scanning for prey and predators. Risks are minimized because of the proximity to refuge. Flight initiation dis- tance increased weakly with starting distance in Sceloporus virgatus Smith, 1938 significantly only at rapid approach speed. It was not significant in Urosaurus ornatus (Baird and Girard, 1852) at slow approach speed. Flight initiation distance is predicted to increase with starting distance, owing to monitoring costs and assessment by prey of greater risk during prolonged approaches. The significant effect in S. virgatus, which lacks monitoring costs, is the first indica- tion that risk affects the relationship between starting distance and flight initiation distance. Conditions in which start- ing distance is important and its possible effects in earlier studies are discussed, as well as standardizing approaches and possible artifactual effects of starting distance.},

European short-distance migrants, wintering in temperate areas, have been assumed to be more affected by change in the European climate than long-distance migrants wintering in the tropics. However, we show that long-distance migrants have advanced their spring arrival in Scandinavia more than short-distance migrants. By analyzing a long-term data set from southern Italy, we show that long-distance migrants also pass through the Mediterranean region earlier. We argue that this may reflect a climate-driven evolutionary change in the timing of spring migration.},

The effects of these changes on migratory birds are very speculative due to the lack of detailed studies and the uncertainty in climate models with respect to geographical patterns of changes but pronounced regional and species-specific differences are likely. Terrestrial birds and those using inland wetlands are likely to face more pronounced environmental challenges during migration than coastal migrants. Staging migrants may suffer from deteriorating habitats but they may, on the other hand, be able to counteract adverse conditions owing to considerable plasticity in their migratory performance.},

abstract = {Recent studies have documented strong, top-down predation effects of sea ducks on mussel populations in rocky intertidal communities. However, the impact of these gregarious predators in soft-bottom communities has been largely unexplored. We evaluated effects of predation by wintering surf scoters Melanitta perspicillata and white-winged scoters M, fusca on clam populations in soft-bottom intertidal habitats of the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia. Specifically, we documented spatial and temporal variation in clam density (clams m(-2)), scoter diet composition, and the consequences of scoter predation on clam abundance. Of the 3 most numerous clams, Manila clams Venerupis philippinarum and varnish clams Nuttallia obscurata were the primary prey items of both scoter species, while clams of the genus Macoma were rarely consumed by scoters. Between scoter arrival in the fall and departure in the spring, Manila clams decreased in density at most sample sites, while varnish clam densities did not change or declined slightly. Our estimates of numbers of clams consumed by scoters accounted for most of the observed declines in combined abundance of Manila and varnish clams, despite the presence of numerous other vertebrate and invertebrate species known to consume clams. For Macoma spp., we detected an over-winter increase in density, presumably due to growth of clams too small to be retained by our sieve ({\textless} 5 mm) during fall sampling, in addition to the lack of predation pressure by scoters. These results illustrate the strong predation potential of scoters in soft-bottom intertidal habitats, as well as their potentially important role in shaping community structure.},

@article{Kery2008,
abstract = {1. Species richness is the most widely used biodiversity metric, but cannot be observed directly as, typically, some species are overlooked. Imperfect detectability must therefore be accounted for to obtain unbiased species-richness estimates. When richness is assessed at multiple sites, two approaches can be used to estimate species richness: either estimating for each site separately, or pooling all samples. The first approach produces imprecise estimates, while the second loses site-specific information. 2. In contrast, a hierarchical Bayes (HB) multispecies site-occupancy model benefits from the combination of information across sites without losing site-specific information and also yields occupancy estimates for each species. The heart of the model is an estimate of the incompletely observed presence-absence matrix, a centrepiece of biogeography and monitoring studies. We illustrate the model using Swiss breeding bird survey data, and compare its estimates with the widely used jackknife species-richness estimator and raw species counts. 3. Two independent observers each conducted three surveys in 26 1-km(2) quadrats, and detected 27-56 (total 103) species. The average estimated proportion of species detected after three surveys was 0.87 under the HB model. Jackknife estimates were less precise (less repeatable between observers) than raw counts, but HB estimates were as repeatable as raw counts. The combination of information in the HB model thus resulted in species-richness estimates presumably at least as unbiased as previous approaches that correct for detectability, but without costs in precision relative to uncorrected, biased species counts. 4. Total species richness in the entire region sampled was estimated at 113.1 (CI 106-123); species detectability ranged from 0.08 to 0.99, illustrating very heterogeneous species detectability; and species occupancy was 0.06-0.96. Even after six surveys, absolute bias in observed occupancy was estimated at up to 0.40. 5. Synthesis and applications. The HB model for species-richness estimation combines information across sites and enjoys more precise, and presumably less biased, estimates than previous approaches. It also yields estimates of several measures of community size and composition. Covariates for occupancy and detectability can be included. We believe it has considerable potential for monitoring programmes as well as in biogeography and community ecology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of renal replacement therapy (RRT) among patients aged ≥65 years is much higher in Flanders, the Dutch speaking region of Belgium, than in The Netherlands. We studied whether differences in referral policy to nephrologists by primary care physicians (PCPs) and specialists between Flanders and The Netherlands may play a role. METHODS: A vignette study was performed among 329 PCPs and 96 specialists in Flanders and compared to the vignette study that was conducted among 209 PCPs and 162 specialists in The Netherlands. Physicians were offered six vignettes concerning case reports of patients with chronic kidney disease and varying co-morbidities or social circumstances. Each vignette was presented for a 65- and an 80-year-old patient. Physicians were asked about the likelihood of referral of the patients in the given circumstances. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to identify whether country affected the likelihood of referral. RESULTS: Univariate analyses showed that the percentage of PCPs who would probably or definitely refer a 65- or an 80-year-old patient with less severe co-morbidity was significantly (P ≤ 0.001) higher in The Netherlands than in Flanders. However, the likelihood of referral of PCPs-concerning patients with more severe co-morbidity did not differ significantly. Specialists in Flanders did not differ in the likelihood to refer patients from that of specialists in The Netherlands. Logistic regression analysis showed that country (higher referral in The Netherlands) was an important predictor for the referral of PCPs, and this was especially the case for patients with less severe co-morbidity. These patterns persisted, even after controlling for other possible predictors as physicians' age, gender, religion and years in practice. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the lower RRT incidence in The Netherlands cannot be explained by a more restrictive referral policy among physicians in The Netherlands. The data suggested that the latter group had a similar or even more liberal attitude to the referral of older patients than physicians in Flanders.},

abstract = {The rapid response of animals to changes in predation risk has allowed behavioral ecologists to learn much about antipredator decision making. A largely unappreciated aspect of such decision making, however, is that it may be fundamentally driven by the very thing that allows it to be so readily studied: temporal variation in risk. We show theoretically that temporal variability in risk leaves animals with the problem of allocating feeding and antipredator efforts across different risk situations. Our analysis suggests that an animal should exhibit its greatest antipredator behavior in high-risk situations that are brief and infrequent. An animal should also allocate more antipredator effort to high-risk situations and more feeding to low-risk situations, with an increase in the relative degree of risk in high-risk situations. However, the need to feed leaves an animal with little choice but to decrease its allocation of antipredator effort to high-risk situations as they become more frequent or lengthy; here, antipredator effort in low-risk situations may drop to low levels as an animal allocates as much feeding as possible to brief periods of low risk. These conclusions hold under various scenarios of interrupted feeding, state-dependent behavior, and stochastic variation in risk situations. Our analysis also suggests that a common experimental protocol, in which prey animals are maintained under low risk and then exposed to a brief "pulse" of high risk, is likely to overestimate the intensity of antipredator behavior expected under field situations or chronic exposure to high risk.},

abstract = {Levels of anti-predator vigilance often de- crease with group size in birds and mammals. Vigilance may also serve other purposes such as scrounging. While scrounging, individual adopt the vigilant posture to locate and eventually exploit the food discoveries of their com- panions. Models that combine anti-predator alertness and scrounging were developed to examine how changes in scrounger use with group size could alter the shape of the function relating vigilance to group size and whether the additional investment in vigilance while searching could be used to reduce the allocation of time to vigilance while in the food patch. Results indicate that increased alloca- tion of time to scrounging during search can add to the overall level of vigilance and even counteract the expected decrease in vigilance with group size. However, the addition of scrounging was found to have little impact on vigilance while in the food patch. Behavioral effects that are dependent on group size, such as scrounging, may lead to changes in the shape of the vigilance function and may mitigate against any gain garnered from a reduction in individual levels of vigilance in larger groups.},

If the fuel deposition rate is constant along the route and feeding is possible everywhere, it is optimal to divide the journey into steps of equal length. The relationship between fuel deposition rate and departure fuel load is not continuous. If the fuel deposition rate is changing monotonically along the route, step lengths are not constant. Step lengths increase if fuel deposition rates increase along the route and decrease if fuel deposition rates decrease along the route. In both cases the relationship between fuel deposition rate and departure fuel load is also not continuous. These qualitative patterns remain unaffected if different flight range equations are used and if the dependence of time spent flying on departure fuel load is included. If ecological barriers are introduced where fuel deposition is impossible it is in most cases optimal to make a stop at an edge of the barrier. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

abstract = {Effects of freshwater seepage on benthic macrofauna were investigated on the sandy tidal flats near the island of Sylt (German Wadden Sea) in 2002. Several permanent seepage areas (50 to 200 m offshore; up to 200 m 2 in area) were examined, in which salinity ranged from 22-29 outside to 0-16 psu inside seepage areas in the upper 20 cm of sediment during summer low tides. The freshwater seepage areas were characterised by an absence of lugworms (Arenicola marina) and a twelve-fold increase in nereid polychaetes (Nereis diversicolor and N. virens) relative to non-seepage areas. Lugworms and ragworms were scarce in a transition zone, which was colonised by juvenile lugworms. We suggest that nereid polychaetes avoid competition with bioturbating lugworms by adapting to areas of low salinity (freshwater seepage). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cordgrasses in the genus Spartina are good examples of ecosystem engineers that modify habitat structure in estuaries throughout the world. In San Francisco Bay, California, USA, marshes containing native California cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) are being invaded by a hybrid (S. alterniflora x S. foliosa) formed after introduction of S. alterniflora. This study compared vegetation, sediment structure, and infaunal invertebrates in native and invaded marshes. We hypothesized that differences in the physical structure between S. foliosa and hybrid Spartina would be reflected in differences in density, biomass, diversity, and taxonomic composition of infauna. Hybrid Spartina modifies habitat structure more than S. foliosa by producing taller stems, and greater plant biomass both above- and belowground while occupying a much wider tidal range, thereby transforming open mudflats to a vegetated habitat. In general, S. foliosa areas contained significantly higher densities of benthic infauna than adjacent mudflats, while hybrid Spartina areas never contained greater infaunal densities than mudflats. This is because S. foliosa produces a moderate level of structure that can facilitate benthic invertebrates, whereas hybrid Spartina produces so much structure, particularly belowground, that it actually excludes invertebrates. Therefore, we suggest that these two closely related species both act as ecosystem engineers, but with opposing effects on invertebrate communities.},

abstract = {* 1For migratory birds the implications of environmental change may be difficult to predict because they use multiple sites during their annual cycle. Moreover, the migrants' use of these sites may be interdependent. Along the flyway of the Svalbard pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus population, Norwegian farmers use organized scaring to minimize goose use of their grasslands in spring. We assessed the consequences of this practice for regional site use of pink-footed geese along their spring migration route. * 2We used dynamic programming to find the sequence of migratory decisions that maximizes the fitness of female geese during spring migration, assuming scaring impinges on both food-intake rates and predation risk. The parameterization of the model was based on data gathered from individually marked pink-footed geese between 1991 and 2003. * 3The effect of scaring in terms of fitness and site use was most noticeable regarding food-intake rate. Scaring resulted in a redistribution of geese along the flyway. Furthermore, the outcomes of the modelling exercises were highly dependent on whether or not the geese were omniscient or naive: at moderate scaring levels naive geese were predicted to succumb. * 4On a qualitative basis there was good correspondence between the predictions from the model and the empirical evidence gathered to date. * 5Synthesis and applications. Besides highlighting the importance of learning and changing behaviour in an adaptive fashion, our modelling exercise indicated the potential vulnerability of the geese to abrupt environmental change. In addition, the exercise emphasized the interdependence of site use along the migratory flyway. The model supports the necessity for an integrated flyway management approach. In Norway, discussion is ongoing about the future management of the spring conflict between farming interests and geese. Farmers in north and mid-Norway have announced that they will expand the scaring campaign if a long-term solution, including a compensation scheme, is not forthcoming. If scaring on such a large scale is implemented abruptly, it may have severe consequences for the population: management of both the scaring intensity and its geographical extent is urgently required.},

abstract = {There is now ample evidence of the effects of anthropogenic climate change on the distribution and abundance of species. The black-faced spoonbill (Platalea minor) is an endangered migratory species and endemic to East Asia. Using a maximum entropy approach, we predicted the potential wintering distribution for spoonbills and modeled the effects of future climate change. Elevation, human influence index and precipitation during the coldest quarter contributed most to model development. Five regions, including western Taiwan, scattered locations from eastern coastal to central mainland China, coastal areas surrounding the South China Sea, northeastern coastal areas of Vietnam and sites along the coast of Japan, were found to have a high probability of presence and showed good agreement with historical records. Assuming no limits to the spread of this species, the wintering range is predicted to increase somewhat under a changing climate. However, three currently highly suitable regions (northeastern Vietnam, Taiwan and coastal areas surrounding the South China Sea) may face strong reductions in range by 2080. We also found that the center of the predicted range of spoonbills will undergo a latitudinal shift northwards by as much as 240, 450, and 600 km by 2020, 2050 and 2080, respectively. Our findings suggest that species distribution modeling can inform the current and future management of the black-faced spoonbill throughout Asia. It is clear that a strong international strategy is needed to conserve spoonbill populations under a changing climate.},

abstract = {Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are a novel and abundant potential food source for several species of diving ducks in the Great Lakes region. Using predator exclusion cages, behavioral observations, and analyses of duck gizzard contents, we examined the predator-prey relationship between zebra mussels and their duck predators during the fall migratory period in Lake Erie at Point Pelee, Ontario. Diving ducks feeding on zebra mussels in the area reduced mussel biomass by 57{\%} during the period of heaviest feeding, but had no measurable impact on mussel numbers. Birds were size-selective predators, preferentially taking medium and large mussels over the more common small ones, thereby altering the size structure of the mussel population. Ducks were abundant at Point Pelee only during late fall, and differences between cages and control areas had disappeared by the following spring. Overall, ducks had little lasting impact on mussel populations, but mussel abundance may have determined duck concentration in the area. Duck staging populations were higher in 1990, when mussels were more abundant, than in 1991, when mussels were much scarcer. Effective predator control of zebra mussels in the portion of the Great Lakes region that freezes over winter is unlikely because diving ducks are unable to overwinter in the area. However, mussels have become an important food source for diving ducks, and temporary reductions of mussel density through predation are likely in areas where ducks feed during migratory periods. Similarly, in regions where ducks are resident through winter, greater and longer lasting effects may be observed.},

abstract = {Plasma metabolite profiling offers a potential means to assess stopover refueling performance of migratory birds from a single capture. However, this method has not previously been validated where site quality has been determined independently using analysis of capture data. We captured and blood sampled six passerine bird species refueling at known high-quality (BASE) and low-quality (TIP) sites at Long Point, Ontario, Canada. Plasma triglyceride, an indicator of fat deposition, was higher at the BASE in three early-season species: the hermit thrush, the American robin, and the white-throated sparrow. Plasma B-OH-butyrate, an indicator of fasting and lipid utilization, was lower at the BASE in the same three species. Plasma glycerol was lower at the BASE in American robins, and plasma phospholipid did not differ between sites. No metabolite suggested better conditions at the TIP in any species. Regression of size-corrected mass on time of day also indicated better refueling performance at the BASE in some species, but metabolite profiling was generally more sensitive to site differences. The relationship between plasma glycerol and triglyceride was U-shaped, indicating high glycerol production during both lipolysis (as was previously known) and rapid fat deposition. Our results confirm the validity of metabolite profiling to assess stopover habitat quality and individual performance in refueling migrants.},

abstract = {Debate over the relative importance of larval availability (recruitment limitation) compared with post-settlement processes, such as competition for limited resources, predation, and physical disturbance, in structuring populations and communities has characterized the literature on rocky intertidal organisms and coral reef fishes for the past decade. Here we apply this same question to marine soft-sediment systems in a synthetic review of all the major processes that may regulate population density and structure communities in this environment. A paradigm established by Gunnar Thorson over 40 years ago still appears to central the views of most soft-sediment ecologists on the importance of recruitment limitation. Thorson maintained that spatial and temporal variability in adult populations of soft-sediment invertebrates is created by the variability of successful completion of the risky planktonic life stage. He argued that the longer duration of planktonic life for planktotrophic species induces greater intrinsic variability in zygote survival, settlement rate, and adult population than is exhibited by lecithotrophic species and direct developers. A review of the literature relating population variability to reproductive mode in soft-sediment marine invertebrates does not provide compelling support for the hypothesis that planktotrophic species have more variable adult population sizes. Furthermore, abundant evidence exists to show that post-settlement mortality can operate to regulate density of invertebrates in soft sediments. Predation by large epibenthic consumers often appears to control infaunal abundances in shallow-water, unvegetated habitats, although hydrodynamic cage artefacts taint that conclusion. Density-dependent inhibition of recruitment by adult deposit-feeders and infaunal predators also has been commonly documented, in most cases operating after settlement. Even where inhibitory adult-juvenile interactions regulate settlement, the existence of this process is inconsistent with recruitment limitation in its strongest form because larval availability is not limiting. Physical disturbance of the sea floor has been shown to erode and kill small infaunal invertebrates, although the full implications of post settlement sedimentary dynamics to pattern generation in soft sediments have not been determined. Finally, although food supply typically regulates benthic secondary production by affecting individual growth and fecundity of adult invertebrates, some evidence also implies density-dependent starvation of recent settlers. Consequently, sufficient information isavailable to show that post-settlement processes play a significant role in population regulation and community organization of soft-sediment benthos to conclude that recruitment limitation is not the dominant determinant of spatial and temporal pattern in this system.},

abstract = {Theory and empirical evidence suggest that predator activity makes prey more wary and less vulnerable to predation. However if at least some prey in the population are energetically or spatially constrained, then predators may eventually increase local prey vulnerability because of the cumulative costs of anti-predation behaviour. We tested whether repeated attacks by a predator might increase prey vulnerability in a system where redshanks on a saltmarsh are attacked regularly by sparrowhawks from adjacent woodland. Cumulative attack number led to a reduction in redshank numbers and flock size (but had no effect on how close redshanks fed to predator-concealing cover) because some redshanks moved to safer but less profitable habitats, leaving smaller flocks on the saltmarsh. This effect held even though numbers of redshank on the saltmarsh increased with time of day. As a result of the change in flock size, predicted attack-success increased up to 1.6-fold for the sparrowhawk, while individual risk of capture for the redshank increased up to 4.5-fold among those individuals remaining on the saltmarsh. The effect did not arise simply because hawks were more likely to attack smaller flocks because attack rate was not dependent on flock size or abundance. Our data demonstrate that when some individual prey are constrained in their ability to feed on alternative, safer foraging sites, their vulnerability to predation increases as predator attacks accumulate, although those, presumably better quality individuals that leave the immediate risky area will have lower vulnerability, so that the mean vulnerability across the entire population may not have changed substantially. This suggests that the selective benefits of multiple low-cost attacks by predators on prey could potentially lead to 1) locally heightened trait-mediated interactions, 2) locally reduced interference among competing predators, and 3) the evolution of active prey manipulation by predators.},

abstract = {Managing natural populations and communities requires detailed information regarding demographic processes at large spatial and temporal scales. This combination is challenging for both traditional scientific surveys, which often operate at localized scales, and recent citizen science designs, which often provide data with few auxiliary information (i.e., no information about individual age or condition). We therefore combine citizen science data at large scales with the demographic resolution afforded by recently developed, site-structured demographic models. We apply this approach to categorical data generated from citizen science representing species density of two managed reef fishes in the Gulf of Mexico, and use a modified Dail-Madsen model to estimate demographic trends, habitat associations, and interannual variability in recruitment. This approach identifies strong preferences for artificial structure for the recovering Goliath grouper, while revealing little evidence of either habitat associations or trends in abundance for mutton snapper. Results are also contrasted with a typical generalized linear mixed-model (GLMM) approach, using real-world and simulated data, to demonstrate the importance of accounting for the statistical complexities implied by spatially structured citizen science data. We conclude by discussing the increasing potential for synthesizing demographic models and citizen science data, and the management benefits that can be accrued.},

abstract = {Social foraging differs from individual foraging because it alters both resource availability and the forager's behavior.We examined responses of starlings to the presence of conspecifics by manipulating foraging-group density experimentally, while ensuring that each subject's foraging opportunities were unchanged. To do this, we used individuals foraging simultaneously in four bottomless enclosures placed at various separations in natural foraging grounds.We measured foraging and scanning intensity and qualitative aspects of scanning of focal individuals. Additionally, we examined the temporal distribution of scanning between individuals. The focal individual analysis showed that (1) food-searching activity increased, while time spent scanning, time off the ground and scanning bout length decreased with flock density; (2) food finding per unit of searching effort increased with density; (3) head orientation during scanning was sensitive to companions' proximity: heads pointed away from the companions at close distance, toward them at intermediate distance, and was random farther away. The analysis of the (temporal overlapping in scanning) temporal distribution of scanning for the group showed that scanning was significantly synchronized when companions were adjacent to each other but was not significantly different from random at further separations. We conclude that behavioral responses of individuals to the presence of others generate important changes in foraging performance even in the absence of physical interference and, more generally, that assessing the mechanisms that control the behavior of group members at different flock densities offers a way to understand the functional and ecological significance of foraging aggregations},

abstract = {The degree to which foraging and vigilance are mutually exclusive is crucial to understanding the management of the predation and starvation risk trade-off in animals. We tested whether wild-caught captive chaffinches that feed at a higher rate do so at the expense of their speed in responding to a model sparrowhawk flying nearby, and whether consistently good foragers will therefore tend to respond more slowly on average. First, we confirmed that the time taken to respond to the approaching predator depended on the rate of scanning: as head-up rate increased so chaffinches responded more quickly. However, against predictions, as peck rate increased so head-up rate increased and mean length of head-up and head-down periods decreased. Head-up rate was probably dependent on peck rate because almost every time a seed was found, a bird raised its head to handle it. Therefore chaffinches with higher peck rates responded more quickly. Individual chaffinches showed consistent durations of both their head-down and head-up periods and, therefore, individuals that were good foragers were also good detectors of predators. In relation to the broad range of species that have a similar foraging mode to chaffinches, our results have two major implications for predation/starvation risk trade-offs: (i) feeding rate can determine vigilance scanning patterns; and (ii) the best foragers can also be the best at detecting predators. We discuss how our results can be explained in mechanistic terms relating to fundamental differences in how the probabilities of detecting food rather than a predator are affected by time. In addition, our results offer a plausible explanation for the widely observed effect that vigilance continues to decline with group size even when there is no further benefit to reducing vigilance.},

@article{Spector2008d,
abstract = {Every object in R contains a number of attributes to describe the nature of the information in that object. Two of the most important attributes of data in R are the mode and the class. When managing data, it is important to understand the differences among the different types of data that R supports, and when problems arise with data, the problem is often that the data is the incorrect mode or class for a particular operation. The mode function returns the mode of any object in R, and the class function returns the class. When working with data, the most commonly en-countered modes of individual objects are numeric, character, and logical. However, since data in R usually revolves around a collection of data (for example, a matrix or dataset), other modes will often be encountered. When deciding on how data should be stored in R, one important consideration has to do with the mode of the data being studied. Some objects (like matrices or other arrays) demand that all the data contained in them be of the same mode; others (like lists and data frames) allow for multiple modes within a single object. In addition to the mode and class function, the typeof function can some-times provide additional information about the type of an object, although it is not generally as useful as that returned by mode or class. One other consideration when planning how data should be entered into R has to do with categorical data. R provides the factor class to store this type of data, and factors are automatically treated specially in statistical models and plotting functions. Values stored as factors require less storage than regular values, because R need only store each unique level once. If you examine the mode of a factor object, you'll notice that it is always numeric, even though it may display as character data, so special care is needed when working with factors. The class function, or one of the predicate functions described in Section 1.3 can be used to recognize factors once they are stored in R. Further information about factors can be found in Chapter 5. 2 1 D a t ai nR Another important data type concerns dates and times. While this sort of information can be stored as a simple character representation, it is difficult to manipulate in this form. R provides several mechanisms for storing dates, in-cluding the built-in Date, POSIXlt, and POSIXct classes, and the contributed chron package. The differences among these different representations as well as information on manipulating dates and times are provided in Chapter 4. Finally, one of the most often encountered modes of data is the list. Lists are the most flexible way of storing data in R, since they can accommodate objects of different modes and lengths. Many functions in R use lists to hold their results, and lists provide a very attractive way of accumulating informa-tion incrementally. When you've got a list and need to find the modes of the components of the list, the sapply function (discussed in detail in Section 8.3) can be used as shown in the following example:},

abstract = {Social foraging is common and may provide benefits of safety and public information. Public information permits faster and more accurate estimates of patch resource densities, thus allowing more effective foraging. In this paper we report on two experiments with red knots Calidris canutus, socially foraging shorebirds that eat bivalves on intertidal mudflats. The first experiment was designed to show that red knots are capable of using public information, and whether dominance status or sex affected its use. We showed that knots can detect the foraging success of conspecifics and choose a patch accordingly. Neither dominance status nor sex influenced public information use. In the second experiment, by manipulating group size, we investigated whether public information use affected food-patch discovery rates and patch residence times. We showed that the time needed before locating a food patch decreased in proportion to group size. Also, an individual's number of patch visits before locating the food declined with group size, and, to our surprise, their average patch residence time did as well. Moreover, knots differed in their search strategy in that some birds consistently exploited the searching efforts of others. We conclude that socially foraging knots have the potential to greatly increase their food-finding rate by using public information.

abstract = {1. The carrying capacity of a site for migratory water birds, expressed
in bird-days, can be of particular conservation value. Several attempts
have been made to model this carrying capacity using ideal free
distribution models such as, for instance, depletion models, in which
the distribution is fully determined by exploitative competition.
2. In the tests of depletion models carried out so far, no alternative
models were compared; rather, one specific model was tested. We tested
whether bird-days were more in accordance with birds depleting the food
resource (a1) until a critical food density which just enabled survival
or (a2) until a threshold food density which renders the site as
profitable as an alternative site; and birds (b1) satisfying their daily
requirements or (b2) maximizing daily intake.
3. We studied Bewick's swans feeding on below-ground tubers of fennel
pondweed in one part of an autumn staging site. In most years between
1995 and 2005, we measured tuber biomass densities around September,
November and March, and counted swans daily during their stopover in
October.
4. The best fit between observed and predicted bird-days was obtained by
assuming that the swans were maximizing their daily intake and depleting
the tubers until a threshold biomass density (which yielded the same
energetic return as the alternative food source after accounting for a
small part of the initial tuber biomass being out of reach of the
swans). Also in line with daily intake maximization, the daily feeding
time did not differ from 10 h day(-1), the value predicted for Bewick's
swans based on their feeding costs.
5. Our results suggests that the applicable model to calculate carrying
capacity may depend strongly on whether birds use a site to stopover or
to winter, because it determines whether the birds are more likely to
use a threshold or critical food density, and to behave as energy
maximizers or satisficers.},

abstract = {Large-scale changes in predator populations are occurring worldwide due to (re-)introductions, over-exploitation, or recovery after decimation by pesticides and persecution. These widespread changes may affect the distribution of their prey. We studied the continental-scale distributions of non-breeding Calidris alpina pacifica and C. a. hudsonia (Pacific and Atlantic dunlins, respectively), as numbers of their major predators---peregrines (Falco peregrinus) and merlins (F. columbarius; together `falcons')---increased after DDT was banned in 1973. For the period 1975--2010 we compiled the number of dunlins and falcons in each of 244 Christmas Bird Count circles, which cover most of the dunlins' non-breeding ranges. Over the study period, falcons increased by 6.5- (Pacific) and 3.1- (Atlantic) fold, spread to more count circles, and the number of dunlins per falcon fell. The annual total count of the two dunlin sub-species fluctuated strongly and independently. We measured annual aggregation as the expected proportion of a subspecies total found on the same count circle as a randomly selected dunlin. The average aggregation of Pacific dunlins (0.117) was about double that of Atlantic dunlins (0.059), with annual variation largely attributable to changes in a few large count circles. The slope of the aggregative response to year-on-year changes in dunlin numbers was identical on the two coasts. The response to the ongoing falcon increase was positive and significant on the Pacific and slightly negative on the Atlantic. We interpret these results using a version of the ideal free distribution that includes predation danger.},

abstract = {Past studies of bird migration times have shown great variation in migratory responses to climate change. We used 33 years of bird capture data (1970-2002) from Manomet, Massachusetts to examine variation in spring migration times for 32 species of North American passerines. We found that changes in first arrival dates - the unit of observation used in most studies of bird migration times - often differ dramatically from changes in the mean arrival date of the migration cohort as a whole. In our study, the earliest recorded springtime arrival date for each species occurred 0.20 days later each decade. In contrast, the mean arrival dates for birds of each species occurred 0.78 days earlier each decade. The difference in the two trends was largely explained by declining migration cohort sizes, a factor not examined in many previous studies. We found that changes in migration cohort or population sizes may account for a substantial amount of the variation in previously documented changes in migration times. After controlling for changes in migration cohort size, we found that climate variables, migration distance, and date of migration explained portions of the variation in migratory changes over time. In particular, short-distance migrants appeared to respond to changes in temperature, while mid-distance migrants responded particularly strongly to changes in the Southern Oscillation Index. The migration times of long-distance migrants tended not to change over time. Our findings suggest that previously reported changes in migration times may need to be reinterpreted to incorporate changes in migration cohort sizes},

abstract = {We analyzed capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data from 1,061 Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) using Humboldt Bay, California, during northward migration (Jan–May), 2000–2001. We estimated immigration and emigration rates, and calculated stopover duration (length of stay), volume (total number of birds using the Bay), and chronology (time frame of the migration at this site). Migration of Brant through Humboldt Bay began in late December and ended in mid-May with peak numbers occurring in mid-March (i.e., 13{\%} of the entire flyway population). Median age of newly arrived birds was highest in the first half of February. Immigration probability was nearly constant, but emigration probability increased through time, indicating a seasonally progressive migratory state. Mean (±SE) stopover duration from all birds for January–April at Humboldt Bay was 26 ± 2 days. Stopover duration was inversely related to bird age due to age-specific emigration probabilities; older birds arrived sooner and stayed for less time than younger birds. Estimates of stopover duration from concurrent radiotelemetry of 12 birds were consistent with CMR model selection-derived estimates. Humboldt Bay was visited by approximately 28{\%} of the Pacific Flyway Black Brant population in 2000 and 58{\%} in 2001. Estimates derived from this technique offer statutory authorities improved information upon which to base management action along migratory pathways.},

abstract = {Top predators may induce extensive cascading effects on lower trophic levels, for example, through intraguild predation (IGP). The impacts of both mammalian and avian top predators on species of the same class have been extensively studied, but the effects of the latter upon mammalian mesopredators are not yet as well known. We examined the impact of the predation risk imposed by a large avian predator, the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos, L.), on its potential mammalian mesopredator prey, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes, L.), and the pine marten (Martes martes, L.). The study combined 23years of countrywide data from nesting records of eagles and wildlife track counts of mesopredators in Finland, northern Europe. The predation risk of the golden eagle was modeled as a function of territory density, density of fledglings produced, and distance to nearest active eagle territory, with the expectation that a high predation risk would reduce the abundances of smaller sized pine martens in particular. Red foxes appeared not to suffer from eagle predation, being in fact most numerous close to eagle nests and in areas with more eagle territories. This is likely due to similar prey preferences of the two predators and the larger size of foxes enabling them to escape eagle predation risk. Somewhat contrary to our prediction, the abundance of pine martens increased from low to intermediate territory density and at close proximity to eagle nests, possibly because of similar habitat preferences of martens and eagles. We found a slightly decreasing trend of marten abundance at high territory density, which could indicate that the response in marten populations is dependent on eagle density. However, more research is needed to better establish whether mesopredators are intimidated or predated by golden eagles, and whether such effects could in turn cascade to lower trophic levels, benefitting herbivorous species.},

abstract = {Western sandpipers Calidris mauri on southward migration fly over the Gulf of Alaska to the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, where they stop for a few days to replenish reserves before continuing. In the Strait, individuals captured on the extensive tidal mudflats of the Fraser estuary (similar to 25000 ha) are significantly heavier (2.71 g, or {\textgreater} 10{\%} of lean body mass) than those captured on the small ({\textless} 100 ha) mudflat of nearby Sidney Island. Previous work has shown that the difference cannot be attributed to seasonal timing, size, age or gender effects, and here we compare predictions made by six hypotheses about a diverse set of data to explain why, partway through a migratory journey of similar to 10 000 km, birds have such different body masses at two stopover sites within 40 km of each other. The 'trade-off' hypothesis - that the large Fraser estuary offers safety from predators, but a lower fattening rate, while the small Sidney Island site is more dangerous, but offers a higher fattening rate - made six successful predictions, all of which were upheld by the data. All other hypotheses failed at least one prediction. We infer that calidrid sandpipers arriving in the Strait of Georgia with little fat remaining (and therefore low body mass) choose to take advantage of the high feeding rate at small sites like Sidney Island because they are less vulnerable to avian predators than are individuals with higher fat reserves, who instead elect to feed at large open sites like the Fraser estuary mudflats.},

abstract = {The effect of predation by curlew sandpipers Calidris ferruginea L. and grey plovers Pluvialis squatarola (L.) on populations of nereid worms Ceratonereis keiskama (Day) and C. erythraeensis (Fauvel) was studied at the Berg River estuary, South Africa, by comparing observations of shorebird-foraging intensity with the results of a population study of two species of nereid worms within and outside bird exclosures. The study was carried out during the four-month period prior to northward migration of shorebirds. Population structure of the two nereid species differed considerably. Ceratonereis keiskama reproduced earlier than C. erythraeensis and only young individuals were present during the study. By contrast, old C. erythraeensis were available to the birds at the start of the experiment and young animals entered the population during the experiment. Despite selective predation on certain size classes of nereids by the birds, no significant changes in the population structure of either nereid were detected by the cage experiment. Numbers and biomass of both Ceratonereis spp. in paired controls and cages tracked each other and did not diverge as predicted. A consistent difference in the depth stratification of the two nereids may, however, have been due to predation pressure. Curlew sandpipers were calculated to remove 3112 nereids per m2 during the three months, equivalent to 4.4 g (dry weight) per m2. This represents 58{\%} of the initial numbers and 77{\%} of the initial biomass of nereids. Although predation on nereids by waders was exceptionally high at the Berg River estuary, any depletion in numbers or biomass of nereids caused by these predators was masked by the reproduction of the nereids. The fact that the predators' high energy requirements prior to northward migration coincide with the period of peak production of invertebrate prey makes the Berg River estuary an exceptionally favourable wintering area.},

abstract = {The relative roles that predation and competition play in regulating populations of infaunal marine bivalves in soft-bottom systems are strikingly different. Exploitative competition for food typically occurs at elevated densities, but crowding rarely results in mortality and competitive exclusion. Predation by decapods, gastropods, and, sometimes asteroids, is more important in controlling patterns of distribution and abundance. Most field tests leading to this synthesis have been conducted between 35 degreesN and 35 degreesS and/or with bivalves in the families Veneridae and Tellinidae. To test the robustness of these ecological processes at another geographic setting (45 degreesN) using a species from another family within the suspension-feeding guild (Myidae), we per-formed a short-term field manipulation at an intertidal mud flat in eastern Maine, USA. We followed survival and growth of 10,080 juveniles (12.4-mm shell length (SL)) of the soft-shell clam, Mya arenaria L., in field enclosures with and without predator-deterrent netting at three densities (330, 660 and 1320 m(-2)) along a tidal gradient over four sampling intervals from April to December 1996. We used a generalized completely randomized block design to assess variation in these dependent variables within a given tidal height (high, mid, and low) on a particular date. Mortality varied seasonally, peaking (13.6{\%}) between August and September when seawater temperatures were warmest. No significant mortality occurred after September, when mean (+/- 95{\%} CI) percent survival pooled over all treatments was 72.9 +/- 8.5{\%}. Netting (6.4-mm aperture) effectively excluded predators along the tidal gradient as overall mean clam survival, independent of tidal position, was 88.7 +/- 4.1{\%} in protected units (plastic plant pots with area = 181 cm(2)), but decreased from upper and mid tide levels (82.9 +/- 6.1{\%}) to lower on the shore (66.3 +/- 9.7{\%}) in unprotected units. Density-dependent mortality resulted in reduced survival (-4.6{\%}) in clams stocked at the two highest levels (P {\textless} 0.001); however. numbers of dead clams with undamaged valves provided little evidence that this effect was due to starvation. Incremental growth also varied seasonally with greatest a-mounts of shell added during June-August at all tidal levels. Shell growth stopped or slowed significantly after September at all tidal positions. Mean SL increased with decreasing tidal height (December sizes: high = 20.6 {\textless}plus/minus{\textgreater} 2.9 mm, mid = 24.1 +/- 1.0 mm; low = 28.2 +/- 1.2 mm), however. submergence time alone failed to explain completely these differences. Density-dependent growth was detected once (August-September). Animals at the two highest densities experienced a growth depression of ca. 7{\%}. We conclude predation, rather than competition, is more important in regulating populations of soft-shell clams in this intertidal location. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A microcosm experiment was carried out to determine the effects of the activity of the burrowing polychaete Nereis virens (Sars) on the associated meiofauna. The sediment basin (76 x 41 cm) was filled with 10 cm of sandy sediment previously sieved with a l-mm mesh to remove any undesired macrofauna and macrodetritus. Fifteen 13-cm long polyvinyl-chloride (PVC) tubes (I.D. = 10 cm) were pushed into the sediment to partition treatments. Nereis were added to the tubes at two densities, low (N = 1) and high (N = 3). Five tubes were: used as controls (no Nereis), while two sets of five tubes were used for the low (L) and high (H) density treatments, respectively. After 14 days, meiofauna was sampled by coring. Cores were cut into three slices: surface (0-1 cm), subsurface (1-5 cm), and deep (5-10). High densities of Nereis (H) significantly affected nematodes, harpacticoid copepods, and nauplii abundance. However, lower abundances were found only in the top cm of the sediment. Moreover, a significant number of dead nematodes found in this sediment layer of treatment H allowed a distinction between sediment disturbance effects and predation effects. Sediment disturbance caused by Nereis may be related to an intensive "ploughing" of surface sediment during food-searching activity. Diversity indices were affected only in the top cm of the sediment with generally lower values in treatment H. Differences in the relative survival of the different feeding groups were found in treatment H, where microvores and deposit feeders respectively showed greater and lower survival. Multivariate analysis (multidimensional scaling) revealed significant differences in nematode species composition among treatments in all sediment layers. It is concluded that N. virens significantly affects meiofauna mostly by disturbance of the top cm of the sediment where its predation represents an influent force as well. The structure of nematode assemblages in subsurface and deeper sediment layers is also affected, most likely by changes in redox conditions caused by the bioirrigating effects of Nereis burrows.

abstract = {Theory predicts that if extending parental care delays migratory departure, and if later migration is more dangerous, then parental care should be curtailed to make an earlier departure. Adult western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) depart Alaska in July, and the presence of peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) along their route rises steeply during the migratory period. Pacific dunlins (C. alpina pacifica) are ecologically similar, but do not depart Alaska until October, after peregrine passage has peaked. Because peregrine migration begins earlier in years with early snowmelt, we predicted that the curtailment of parental investment by western sandpiper, but not of Pacific dunlins, should be more pronounced in these more dangerous years. We measured breeding phenology of these species on the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge during three seasons with strongly differing snowmelt timing. We found that they initiated breeding simultaneously, and that western sandpipers, but not Pacific dunlins, ceased laying increasingly earlier, provided increasingly less parental care and departed increasingly sooner as snowmelt was earlier. Advancing departure date by the overall average of 5.2d relative to dunlin reduces migratory exposure to peregrines by an estimated 18{\%}. Our results support the hypothesis that natural selection has favored curtailment of parental investment by western sandpipers to advance migratory departure.},

abstract = {Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) have been previously shown to undergo seasonal changes in the fatty acid composition of their fat stores, even though they do not show the marked seasonal variation in diet common to many migratory passerines. We investigated the effect of dietary fatty acid composition on the fatty acid composition of adipose tissue in captive Western Sandpipers by feeding birds experimental diets with different fatty acid composition. In addition, we determined the effect of total percentage of fat content of the diet (5 vs. 10{\%}) on fatty acid composition of depot fat. Birds maintained normal body mass (24-27 g) throughout all experimental treatments. Most adipose fatty acids were sensitive to dietary manipulation to some extent. Changes in fatty acid composition of the diet had the largest effect on adipose tissue composition for the essential polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleate (18:2), whereas it bad the least effect for the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate (18:1). The saturated fatty acid palmitate (16:0) demonstrated an intermediate capacity to alter fatty acid composition of adipose tissue. Total amount of fat in the diet did not influence the effect of diet on fatty acid deposition. Results of dietary manipulations in this study suggest that diet does explain some of the variation in fatty acid composition observed during migration in Western Sandpipers, but that certain fatty acids can be modulated independently of diet (probably through de novo synthesis, postabsorption modification, or both).},

abstract = {We develop a unified framework for jointly defining population dynamics models and measurements taken on a population. The framework is a state-space model where the population processes are modelled by the state process and measurements are modelled by the observation process. In many cases, the expected value for the state process can be represented as a generalisation of the standard population projection matrix: each sub-process within the state process may be modelled by a separate matrix and the product of these matrices is a generalised Leslie matrix. By selecting appropriate matrices and their ordering, a wide range of models may be specified. The method is fully flexible for allowing stochastic variation in the processes. Process parameters may themselves be modelled as functions of covariates. The structure accommodates effects such as density dependence, competition and predator-prey relationships, and metapopulations are readily modelled. Observations on the population enter through an observation process model, and we show how likelihood functions can be built that reflect both demographic stochasticity (which appears in the state process) and stochastic errors in the observations. Parameter estimation and estimation of state process variables can be conducted using sequential Monte Carlo procedures. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {While it is clear that many migratory behaviors are shared across taxa, generalizable models that predict the distribution and abundance of migrating taxa at the landscape scale are rare. In migratory landbirds, ephemeral concentrations of refueling birds indicate that individual behaviors sometimes produce large epiphenomena in particular geographic locations. Identifying landscape factors that predict the distribution and abundance of birds during migratory stopover will both improve our understanding of the migratory process and assist in broad, regionally relevant conservation. In this study we used autumnal passerine stopover data from a five-year period and eleven stopover sites across coastal Maine, USA, to test four broad hypotheses of migrant distribution and abundance that have been supported in other regions: a) the community characteristics of the pool of potential migrants, b) a site's local geography, c) landscape composition and configuration measured at different spatial scales, and d) interactions between these factors. Our final model revealed that birds concentrate at ‘habitat islands', sites that possess a disproportionate percentage of the vegetated habitat in the 4-km surrounding landscape. The strength of this pattern, however, was inversely proportional to a species' remaining migratory distance. Our results corroborate several studies that emphasize the importance of land cover composition at finer spatial scales (? 80 km2) for predicting the stopover distribution and abundances of migratory birds. This suggests that different migrants likely assess stopover sites with similar mechanisms along their migratory route, and these commonalities may be broadly applied to identify stopover locations of conservation importance across the continent.},

abstract = {A negative relationship between group size and levels of individual vigilance is widespread in socially feeding vertebrates. The main explanation of this 'group-size effect', the many-eyes hypothesis, is based on the simple premise that as group size increases, there are progressively more eyes scanning the environment for predators. Thus an individual forager can devote less time to vigilance (and more time to feeding) as group size increases without any lessening of the group's ability to detect an attack. Basic to this hypothesis is the assumption of collective detection: that all members of the group are alerted to an attack as long as it is detected by at least one individual. In addition, an important presumption associated with the many-eyes hypothesis is that individuals monitor the. vigilance behaviour of their groupmates in determining their own level of vigilance. Neither the idea of collective detection nor behavioural monitoring received strong support in an experimental study of vigilance in mixed flocks of dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, and American tree sparrows, Spizella arborea. The lack of support for behavioural monitoring was particularly evident; however, some degree of collective detection was apparent. It is possible that anti-predatory rules-of-thumb may explain the group-size effect while keeping intact the basics of the many-eyes hypothesis.},

abstract = {Quantifying the effect of disturbance is a central issue in conservation. Using time and energy budgets, we obtain a range of ways to assess the importance of disturbance. One measure is the time that must be spent foraging in order to balance the energy budget. From this we derive critical levels of wastage (rate of disturbance multiplied by duration of disturbance) at which the animal runs out of time or reaches a limit on energy expenditure. In the case of the time constraint, the critical wastage is the net rate of energetic gain while foraging divided by the rate of energetic expenditure during a disturbance. The associated critical rate of disturbance is the net rate of energetic gain while foraging divided by the energy spent during a disturbance. The model is illustrated using data from the African wild dog, which suffers disturbance from lions and kleptoparasitism from hyenas. Findings suggest that disturbance imposes significant costs on wild dog time and energy budgets. We show how alternative environments can be evaluated in terms of their effective rate of gain, which is the net rate of gain from foraging minus the rate of energy expenditure as a result of disturbance.},

abstract = {Different spatial distributions of food abundance and predators may urge birds to make a trade-off between food intake and danger. Such a trade-off might be solved in different ways in migrant birds that either follow a time-minimizing or energy-minimizing strategy; these strategies have been assigned to two subspecies of Bar-tailed Godwits Limosa lapponica that use the European Wadden Sea during northward migration. At the study area on Terschelling, we recorded feeding site selection, time budgets and intake rates (prey/min) in the period that both lapponica (energy minimizer) and taymyrensis (time minimizer) subspecies were present (late April till the end of May 2007). Prey availability (number of prey/m2) was negatively correlated to the distance from cover. Based on sightings of colour-ringed Bar-tailed Godwits, taymyrensis was foraging closer to cover, and for a higher proportion of time than lapponica (67{\%} vs. 33{\%}). During the high tide period taymyrensis was also foraging on inland coastal meadows. Moreover, taymyrensis was more vigilant than lapponica, whereas lapponica showed more resting and preening behaviour. Lapponica had a higher instantaneous intake rate, but taymyrensis had a higher overall intake rate and the birds were more successful in taking larger prey items than lapponica. Supposedly, due to the increased foraging time and additional foraging on the inland meadows, the time-minimizing taymyrensis achieved a higher fuel deposition rate than lapponica. Taymyrensis shifted towards food-rich areas, apparently accepting higher predation risks, whereas energy-minimizing lapponica avoided predation danger by foraging further from cover.},

abstract = {Science and stories are not the same thing, although sto-ries have long been the outward face of conservation science. The rate of species' extinctions that framed the launch of our discipline was too high not to use whatever communication tools would be most effective to get peo-ple to address the crisis. We practiced science, and sci-ence structured the programs conservation practitioners implemented, but science showed no promise of chang-ing peoples' attitudes and behaviors. Stories did that, and we used them to convince the world of the urgency of paying attention to the global loss of biodiversity (genes, species, and ecosystems). But with the launch of the In-tergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES; www.ipbes.net), we are going to have to more carefully and strategically untangle our stories from our science. The IPBES was established by more than 90 govern-ments in Panama City, Panama, on 21 April 2012 as a " global mechanism recognized by both the scientific and policy communities that will gather, analyze, and synthe-size information to inform decision making in a range of policy fora such as global and regional environmen-tal conventions and development policy dialogues. " The IPBES is promising to provide scientific information on biodiversity and ecosystem services to governments and will have four main functions: identify and prioritize sci-entific information needed by policy makers and catalyze efforts to generate new knowledge, perform regular and timely assessments of knowledge on biodiversity and ecosystem services and their relations; support policy formulation and implementation; and prioritize capacity building and call for financial and other support for the highest priority needs. Although national governments are the major clients of IPBES, there is a major effort to in-volve the scientific community, nongovernmental stake-holders, and civil society in general in its activities. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has called for IPBES to be the " most authoritative, multi-disciplinary, overarching mechanism on biodiversity and ecosystem services " (IUCN 2011). The IPBES has the potential to give conservation sci-ence the visibility that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) gave to climate science. Climate science has captured world attention by relating changes in climate to events that affect the lives of people (e.g., sea-level rise, severe storms), while conservation science has languished. The lack of world attention to our dis-cipline may change as activities designed to increase governments' attention to biodiversity and its connec-tions to human welfare are conducted by the IPBES (Perring et al. 2011; Vohland et al. 2011). Many commen-tators have remarked on the similarity between IPBES and IPCC. The journal Nature (2010) editorialized, " Wanted: an IPCC for Biodiversity, " and Larigauderie and Mooney (2010) call for IPBES to be an " IPCC-like mechanism for biodiversity. " We suggest that conservation professionals need to be careful as biodiversity conservation becomes the priority we hoped it would. The stories conservation practition-ers have told to gain public support may be chosen for analysis rather than the science underlying them. Our reliance on storytelling is understandable because story-telling is an ancient human behavior and a very effective way to engage an audience. We tell compelling stories about the impending loss of a species and the speed of ecosystem destruction. We tell success stories to in-spire people to replicate success. These stories, originally told by conservation practitioners, are written down and widely shared by public affairs, development, and com-munication scribes. As with court scribes of old, these scribes make the stories more engaging, more inspiring, and scarier—with the aim of engaging more donors and reaching a broader public. The IPBES and its activities may focus on some of our stories that will not stand up to careful scientific scrutiny. We are concerned about not only the conflation of sto-ries with science, but also about the robustness of the science underlying the stories. If the science is merely an inspiration for the stories then it has probably been shielded from testing and refining through the rough 757},

The metabolic cost of increased temperature could reduce body size but long growing seasons could also increase body size as was recently shown in an Arctic spider species. Here, we present the longest known time series on body size variation in two High-Arctic butterfly species: Boloria char- iclea and Colias hecla. We measured wing length of nearly 4500 individuals collected annually between 1996 and 2013 from Zackenberg, Greenland and found that wing length significantly decreased at a similar rate in both species in response to warmer summers. Body size is strongly related to dispersal capacity and fecundity and our results suggest that these Arctic species could face severe challenges in response to ongoing rapid climate change.},

abstract = {Populations of migratory birds are usually considered to be limited by conditions in breeding or wintering areas, but some might be limited by conditions encountered on migration. This could occur at stopover sites where competition for restricted food supplies can reduce subsequent survival or breeding success, or during the flights themselves, when adverse weather can occasionally kill large numbers of individuals. Competition for food could act in a density-dependent manner and help to regulate populations, whereas weather effects are more likely to act in a density-independent manner. The evidence for these views is explored in this paper. When preparing for migration, birds must normally obtain more food per day than usual, in order to accumulate the body reserves that fuel their flights. Birds often concentrate in large numbers at particular stopover sites, where food can become scarce, thus affecting migratory performance. Rates of weight gain, departure weights, and stopover durations often correlate with food supplies at stopover sites, sometimes influencing the subsequent survival and reproductive success of individuals, which can in turn affect subsequent breeding numbers. Many studies have provided evidence for interference and depletion competition at stopover sites, relatively few for migration conditions influencing the subsequent breeding or survival of individuals, and even fewer for effects on subsequent breeding numbers. Migrants in flight occasionally suffer substantial mortality in storms, especially over water, sometimes involving many thousands of birds at a time. Other mass mortalities have resulted from atypical 'winter-like' weather, occurring soon after the arrival of summer migrants in their breeding areas or just before their departure in autumn. Again, many thousands of birds at a time have been killed in such incidents, causing reductions of 30-90{\%} in local breeding densities. In some bird species, migration-related events can at times have substantial effects on the year-to-year changes in breeding population levels. Nonetheless, the difficulties involved in investigating migrating birds at different points on their migration routes have so far limited the number of studies on the influence of events during migration periods on population levels.},

abstract = {The conservation of key stopover sites for migratory wading birds in important because there are so few and because in some cases they support entire populations. In Minas Basin in the Bay of Fundy, over 500,000 Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) on southward migration feed on the abundant amphipod Corophium volutator. When a baitworm harvesting industry began there in 1985 (focused on bloodworms [Glycera dibranchiata]), concerns were raised about the potential effects of this activity on the foraging behavior of semipalmated Sandpipers and on the density and age structure of their principal prey, C. volutator. Core sampling for invertebrates and paired focal sandpiper observations were undertaken in disturbed (dug) and undisturbed sediment. Semipalmated Sandpiper foraging efficiency decreased by 68.5{\%} in dug sediment, corresponding to observed reductions in prey density. The decreased foraging efficiency may also have been related to reductions in prey availability due to the obstruction of visual and tactile prey cues caused by turning and loosening of the surface sediment. The overall density (adult and juvenile) of C. volutator decreased by 38.8{\%} in dug sediment in the first year of baitworm harvesting, due to direct mortality and lower juvenile recruitment. Juvenile C. volutator were particularly susceptible to disturbance (55{\%} decrease in dug sediment); because they overwinter to become the next year's potential breeders, this decrease can be expected to compound with each subsequent year of harvesting. All the significant, negative effects of baitworm harvesting on Semipalmated Sandpiper foraging behavior and on the density and age structure of their principal prey, C. volutator, were realized after only one season of digging. Semipalmated Sandpipers foraging in harvested areas may take longer to deposit the fat required for migration, thereby delaying their arrival on the wintering grounds or forcing them to depart without sufficient fat loads.},

Here, I capitalize on the remarkable 9-day synchronicity in which 90{\%} of moose neonates in the Yellow- stoneEcosystem areborn, to demonstratea substantive change in how prey avoid predators; birth sites shift away from traffic-averse brown bears and towards paved roads. The decade- long modification was associated with carnivore recolonization, but neither mothers in bear-free areas nor non-parous females altered patterns of landscape use. These findings offer rigorous support that mammals use humans to shield against carnivores and raise the possibility that redistribution has occurred in other mammalian taxa due to human presence in ways we have yet to anticipate. To interpret ecologically function- ing systems within parks, we must now also account for indirect anthropogenic effects on species distributions and behaviour.},

This is demonstrated most spectacularly during the vast migratory journeys made by these animals year after year, often between continents and occasionally global in nature. However, it remains one of the great unanswered questions in science, despite more than 50 years of research in this field. Nevertheless, the study of true navigation in birds has made signifi- cant advances in the previous 20 years, in part thanks to the integration of many disciplines outside its root in behavioural biology, to address questions of neuro- biology, molecular aspects, and the physics of sensory systems and environmental cues involved in bird navigation, often involving quantum physics. However, true navigation remains a controversial field, with many conflicting and confusing results making interpretation difficult, particularly for those outside or new to the field. Unlike many general texts on migration, which avoid discussion of these issues, this review will present these conflicting findings and assess the state of the field of true navigation during bird migration.},

We critically assess Gross's status-dependent selection model and Shuster and Wade's critique. We find shortcomings and misconceptions in both. We return to the findings of the strategic models behind the conditional ESS and demonstrate how environmental threshold models use a reaction norm approach and quantitative genetic theory to understand the evolution of conditional strategies. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {As the evolutionary responses to environmental change depend on selection acting on individual differences, disentangling within- and between-individual variation becomes imperative. In animal migration research, multiyear tracks are thus needed to estimate the individual consistency of phenotypic traits. Avian telemetry studies have recently provided the first evidence of individuality across space and time in animal migration. Here, we compare repeatability patterns of routes and timing between two migratory birds, the marsh harrier, Circus aeruginosus, and the osprey, Pandion haliaetus, as recorded by satellite tracking. We found interspecific contrasts with low repeatability in timing and duration and a high repeatability in routes for ospreys, but the reverse pattern for marsh harriers. This was mainly caused by (1) larger between-individual variation in routes for ospreys (broad-front migration) than for marsh harriers (corridor migration) and a higher degree of repeated use of the same stopover sites among ospreys, and (2) higher within-individual consistency of timing and duration among marsh harriers, while individual ospreys were more flexible. Our findings suggest that individuality in space and time is not a shared trait complex among migrants, but may show adaptive variation depending on the species' life history and ecology.},

abstract = {Movement of animals on intertidal mudflats can have profound consequences for population and community dynamics. Such movement is often influenced by biotic interactions, but the abiotic environment can also be important, affecting the strength of species' interactions and even changing their outcome. Here, we focused on two biotic interactions and examined their effect on movement of the burrow-dwelling amphipod Corophium volutator: intraspecific interactions (specifically, the effect of conspecific density) and interspecific interactions with a competitor-predator, the mud snail Ilyanassa obsoleta (=Nassarius obsoletus). We assessed the magnitude of the temporal variation and examined the influence of pertinent abiotic variables (lunar cycle, presence of tide pools). Despite substantial temporal variation in movement levels, density of conspecifics did not influence emigration or immigration rates of C. volutator. Mud snails negatively affected immigration of C. volutator, and this was consistent across all lunar phases. However, mud snails influenced mortality and emigration of C. volutator in a contrasting way relative to lunar phases; sometimes amphipods evaded snails and survived, but at other times did not emigrate and were killed. The presence of tide pools did not change the nature or strength of the snail-amphipod interaction. Our results further clarify the complex interactions between C. volutator and I. obsoleta and suggest that resources on the mudflat are sufficient to sustain high densities of amphipods in a density-independent manner. Further, they highlight the importance of considering multiple environmental variables when examining interspecific interactions.},

abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that an understanding of avian anti-predatory escape tactics is important in understanding the -av in which predators influence avian ecological systems. of key importance appears to be the way in which a bird's perception of predation risk reflects an interaction between its tactic of escape from attacks and the physical structure of its environment: a given habitat may be avoided as too risky if a bird's escape tactic does not match the physical structure (e.g., vegetational characteristics, aspects of local topography) of that habitat. However, escape tactics in North American birds are poorly characterized. Thus, this survey brings together many observations of predator-prey encounters scattered over a century's worth of ornithological literature in an effort to identify both the major tactics of escape from predatory attack and their respective ecological implications. Various escape tactics also appear to be consistently associated with certain life-history traits, and these associations are explored from both taxonomic and phylogenetic perspectives. The current state of knowledge regarding escape tactics is hindered by incomplete taxonomic coverage of the available observations and various biases in the reporting thereof. Nonetheless, this survey provides further insight into the way in which predators may influence avian ecological systems, even when actual predation in such systems is numerically insignificant.},

abstract = {The consequences of complex trophic interactions for the dynamics of a natural microbenthic community from an intertidal Australian seagrass bed were examined during experiments in January, March, April, and June 1989. Effects of meiofauna and protist density manipulations on bacterial 'numbers and division rates and microalgal biomass were determined over 6 d each month. Results varied among experiments, microbial groups, and vertical positions within the sediment. Meiofaunal effects increased bacterial division rates but not densities in January subsurface and March surface sediments. In June, enhanced meiofaunal densities decreased subsurface but increased surface bacterial densities. A complex, tri-trophic-level interaction among meiofauna, protists, and bacteria probably caused the increased bacterial densities in June surface sediments. Meiofauna had no discernible effect on bacterial densities and division rates in January surface and March subsurface sediments even though relatively small ({\textless} 50{\%}) differences between treatments could be detected with reasonable statistical power. Changes in microalgal biomass could not be attributed to experimental treatments, and meiofauna likely have a limited effect on microalgae in this intertidal seagrass habitat. Results indicate that the combined effects of meiofauna can alter microbial densities and growth rates and significantly affect microbenthic community structure. Spatial and temporal variability in the nature of trophic interactions will determine the cumulative effects of meiofauna on microbial communities.},

abstract = {Detecting declines in populations at broad spatial scales takes enormous effort, and long-term data are often more sparse than is desired for estimating trends, identifying drivers for population changes, framing conservation decisions, or taking management actions. Museum records and historic data can be available at large scales across multiple decades, and are therefore an attractive source of information on the comparative status of populations. However, changes in populations may be real (e.g. in response to environmental covariates) or resulting from variation in our ability to observe the true population response (also possibly related to environmental covariates). This is a (statistical) nuisance in understanding the true status of a population. Evaluating statistical hypotheses alongside more interesting ecological ones is important in the appropriate use of museum data. Two statistical considerations are generally applicable to use of museum records: first without initial random sampling, comparison with contemporary results cannot provide inference to the entire range of a species, and second the availability of only some individuals in a population may respond to environmental changes. Changes in the availability of individuals may reduce the proportion of the population that is present and able to be counted on a given survey event, resulting in an apparent decline even when population size is stable.},

abstract = {Regional patterns of shorebird diets were examined by reviewing 75 papers reporting prey of 43 shorebird species throughout the western hemisphere. Collectively, shorebirds consumed a wide variety of invertebrate taxa, including 12 phyla, 22 classes, 72 orders, 238 families, and 404 genera of invertebrates. The most widely represented invertebrate classes were Insecta, Malacostraca, Gastropoda, Polychaeta, and Bivalvia. The ten most widely studied shorebird species exhibited considerable dietary breadth, consuming an average of 36 (range 23-65) families of invertebrates. Fifteen invertebrate families were common to the diets of seven or more of these ten species. For all shorebird species evaluated, there was little dietary overlap in invertebrate taxa between geographic regions, especially between tidal and inland areas. Diet similarities of species and guilds of shorebirds within regions and of coexisting species within studies were high. The flexible nature of food choice in shorebirds influences management approaches toward providing vital food resources for shorebirds during all seasons. Management efforts should focus on maintaining hydrologic regimes and ecosystem processes that promote the growth and maintenance of invertebrate populations in general; specific taxa need not be targeted. Successful maintenance of wetlands will ensure that naturally-occurring populations of invertebrates occur and are accessible to shorebirds.},

abstract = {By combining the potential flight range of fuel with different migration policies, the optimum departure fuel load for migratory birds can be calculated. We evaluate the optimum departure fuel loads associated with minimization of three different currencies: (1) overall time of migration, (2) energy cost of transport and (3) total energy cost of migration. Predicted departure loads are highest for (1), lowest for (2) and intermediate for (3). Further, currencies (1) and (3) show departure loads dependent on the fuel accumulation rate at stopovers, while (2) is not affected by variation in the rate of fuel accumulation. Furthermore, fuel loads optimized with respect to currency (3) will differ depending on the size (body mass) of the bird and the energy density of the fuel. We review ecological situations in which the various currencies may apply, and suggest how a combination of stopover decisions and observations of flight speed may be used to decide among the three cases of migration policies. Finally, we calculate that the total energy cost of migration is roughly divided between flight and stopover as 1:2. The total time of migration is similarly divided between flight and stopover as 1:7, probably with a relatively longer stopover time in larger species. Hence, we may expect strong selection pressures to optimize the fuel accumulation strategies during stopover episodes. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

While data exist for shorebird population trends for many parts of the world, two thirds of Australia's populations have not been assessed. We report the results of a large-scale aerial shorebird survey, sampling about a third of the Australian continent over a period of 24 years (1983-2006). Migratory shorebirds have declined by 73{\%}, Australian resident shorebirds by 81{\%}. Of the 10 wetlands supporting the highest number of shorebirds within the survey bands, eight were inland wetlands and only two coastal, emphasising the importance of inland wetlands for shorebirds. Wetland area decreased significantly at four of the 10 main sites. Annual rainfall showed no trends (1983-2005) but water extraction was substantial for four of the 10 wetlands, contributing to reduced flooding extent and frequency. Loss of wetlands due to river regulation is a significant contributor to the drastic decline in shorebird numbers in Australia, largely unrecognized in international conservation agreements in Australia.

abstract = {Exclosure experiments are commonly used in marine soft sediments to examine changes in invertebrate density caused by shorebird predation. However, many of these exclosure experiments do not incorporate the spatial variability of the invertebrate prey in their design and/or analysis. This paper uses a short-term exclosure experiment and random sampling (Before/After predation) to assess reductions in invertebrate densities by western sandpiper Calidris mauri on the Fraser River estuary, British Columbia, Canada. During the spring {\textgreater}1 million western sandpiper stop over at the Fraser River estuary on their northward migration to breeding grounds in Alaska. Exclosure experiments and Before/After sampling were conducted at 3 sites on the Fraser River estuary that differed in their sediment characteristics and in their use for feeding by western sandpiper. An examination of cage effects showed that there were no alterations to sediment composition caused by the exclosure cage. However, there were changes in invertebrate numbers in the exclosure cage irrespective of shorebird predation. In particular, mobile invertebrates, such as gastropods and crustaceans, migrated into or out of the exclosure cages during the experiment. Overall, there was little evidence for reduction in invertebrate numbers caused by western sandpiper predation. In the exclosure experiment a significant decline was observed in the phyllodocid polychaete Eteone spp., but at a site with little evidence of shorebird predation. Before/After sampling showed some declines in invertebrate numbers, but this could reflect patchiness in invertebrate distributions rather than the direct action of predation. The use of statistical designs for detecting environmental impacts (e.g. BACI) is suggested for future studies of shorebird predation as they allow for the spatial and temporal variability of the invertebrate prey to be considered concomitant with the impact of the shorebird predator. General problems of sampling with sediment cores, high sample variance, and the reduced power of experimental tests need to be considered in future research on the interactions of shorebird predators and their marine invertebrate prey.},

abstract = {Whether migrating birds compensate for wind drift or not is a fundamental question in bird migration research. The procedures to demonstrate and quantitatively estimate wind drift or compensation are fraught with difficulties and pitfalls. In this paper, we evaluate four methods that have been used in several studies over the past decades. We evaluate the methods by analysing a model migratory movement with a realistic scatter in flight directions, for the ideal cases of full drift and complete compensation. Results obtained with the different methods are then compared with the "true behaviour" of the model movement, illustrating that spurious patterns of drift and compensation arise in some cases. We also illustrate and evaluate the different methods of estimating drift for a real case, based on tracking radar measurements of bird migration in relation to winds. Calculating the linear regression of mean geographic track (resulting flight direction) and heading directions (directions of the birds' body axis) of a migratory movement under different wind conditions in relation to the angle ?? (the angle between mean track and heading) always provides robust and reliable results. Comparing mean flight directions between occasions with winds from the left and right of the mean flight direction of the whole migratory movement also always provides expected and correct measures of drift. In contrast, regressions of individual flight directions in relation to ?? (the angle between track and heading for the specific individuals or flocks) are liable to produce biased and spurious results, overestimating compensation/overcompensation if following winds dominate in the analysis and overestimating drift/overdrift if opposed winds are dominating. Comparing mean directions for cases with winds from the left and right in relation to individual flight directions also gives biased and spurious results unless there is full variation in wind directions or an equal distribution of crosswinds from left and right. The results of the methodological evaluation and the analysis of the real case indicate that some earlier analyses of wind drift may have to be re-evaluated. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {High body mass caused by fat storage during migration is believed to increase a bird's risk of predation by decreasing its ability to escape predators. We demonstrate the negative effect of wing loading (mass/wing area) on escape speed and angle of two migrating species of shorebird. We also show significant differences in escape performance between the species and genders. To help explain these differences, we test two potential proximate causes, wing shape and leg bone length. Wing shape is correlated with differences in escape performance between the species, but we found no correlation of wing shape or leg bone length with gender. Ultimately, greater predation risk due to habitat use or larger body size, for the species and genders respectively, may have resulted in evolution of enhanced escape ability.},

abstract = {We studied non-breeding territorial behavior of Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla), and documented the proportion of individuals of Least (C. minutilla) and Western (C. mauri) sandpipers exhibiting territoriality during fall of 1994 and 1995 at the Cabo Rojo salt flats, Puerto Rico. Territoriality was exhibited by 8-19{\%} of the population, with Least Sandpipers exhibiting the highest proportion of all three species. The prevalence and size of territories of Semipalmated Sandpipers was influenced by the availability of high prey density sites, bird density, and aggression levels. Individuals defended territories in areas of highest prey densities (0.16 +/- 0.009 /cm(3)). Non-territorial birds, however, foraged in areas of significantly higher prey densities (0.02 +/- 0.001 /cm(3)) than overall lagunal levels (i.e., randomly sampled plots) (0.006 +/- 0.009 /cm(3)). Territorial Semipalmated Sandpipers spent less time foraging than non-territorial birds (1994: 90 vs 36{\%}; 1995: 85 vs 55{\%}). They also spent less time in maintenance behavior (i.e., preening). Costs of territoriality may be offset by foraging in areas of high prey densities or through increased foraging efficiency. Prey density did not exert a direct influence on territory size (P = 0.67). Rather, it influenced territory size through effects on aggression. Territory size was inversely related to the mean time spent on aggression (P {\textless} 0.001). Territory size was also inversely related to bird density (P {\textless} 0.001), a factor that might contribute to higher incidence of aggressive bouts. These findings support the contention that a facultative strategy with respect to nonbreeding territorial behavior seems to offer migratory species the flexibility to cope with spatio-temporal fluctuations of prey resources and shorebird density.},

abstract = {Detecting coherent signals of climate change is best achieved by conducting expansive, long-term studies. Here, using counts of waders (Charadrii) collected from ca. 3500 sites over 30 years and covering a major portion of western Europe, we present the largest-scale study to show that faunal abundance is influenced by climate in winter. We demonstrate that the 'weighted centroids' of populations of seven species of wader occurring in internationally important numbers have undergone substantial shifts of up to 115 km, generally in a northeasterly direction. To our knowledge, this shift is greater than that recorded in any other study, but closer to what would be expected as a result of the spatial distribution of ecological zones. We establish that year-to-year changes in site abundance have been positively correlated with concurrent changes in temperature, but that this relationship is most marked towards the colder extremities of the birds' range, suggesting that shifts have occurred as a result of range expansion and that responses to climate change are temperature dependent. Many attempts to model the future impacts of climate change on the distribution of organisms, assume uniform responses or shifts throughout a species' range or with temperature, but our results suggest that this may not be a valid approach. We propose that, with warming temperatures, hitherto unsuitable sites in northeastern Europe will host increasingly important wader numbers, but that this may not be matched by declines elsewhere within the study area. The need to establish that such changes are occurring is accentuated by the statutory importance of this taxon in the designation of protected areas},

abstract = {We develop an analytical model which determines optimal departure fat loads and stopover site use for time-minimizing bird migration with any number of sites, to identify conditions under which birds carry more fat than necessary to reach the next stopover site (overloads) or skip suitable stopover sites. The model is analysed with three sites: the wintering ground, one stopover site (both of which are characterized by their daily fattening rates), and the breeding ground. Overloads and skipping can occur if the sites decrease in quality in the direction of migration. Departure fat loads are usually either at the level necessary to reach the stopover site or at the level for a non-stop flight to the breeding ground; overloads are only deposited under rare circumstances. To model the effects of stochasticity in fat deposition we include explicit functions for the dependence of fitness on arrival time. If overloads are deposited, they are largest when the fitness function is concave, lowest when convex, and intermediate when linear.},

abstract = {A review of stopover behavior in birds revealed that most migrate as quickly as fuel reserves allowed (i.e., were time minimizers). This pattern stemmed from studies conducted almost exclusively on small- bodied species ( 50 g), which migrate primarily by flapping flight. However, body size has a significant effect on metabolic rate and costs of locomotion, two characteristics with direct relevance to migration and stopover behavior. I examined the autumn stopover behavior of a large-bodied species (4–5.5 kg) that migrates by soaring. I captured and radio-tagged 68 Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) at Hauser Reservoir, Montana from 1992–1994. After capture, juveniles stayed at the stopover site longer than older eagles. Body condition was similar between the two age groups and did not correlate with post capture residence time. Consumption rates of eagles were not age-specific. Juvenile and 1.5-year old eagles had similar consumption rates and body con- dition, but differed in residence times, which suggested that experience modified stopover behavior. Stopover behavior of Bald Eagles supported the hypothesis that large species are less sensitive than small species to body condition and consumption rates during migration.},

Individual birds were tested for their latency to come back to a feeding table after a gentle startle (startle latency) in a social and a non-social context. In the social context an accompanying bird was foraging in a parallel section of the same room, separated by a transparent foil. We found a context dependent reaction that differed for both sexes. Females became slower in general in the social test, while male reaction to context change was dependent on behavioural type. Slow males had shorter startle latency in the presence of a companion that decreased with increasing activity of the companying bird, while the latency of fast male explorers was independent on the presence and behaviour of an accompanying bird. These results show that individual differences in behaviour are context dependent and that sexes react differently to the social context. These results are discussed in the perspective of domain specificity and domain generality of personalities.},

Crude oil can disrupt the fine structure and function of feathers, and here we tested for the first time how small amounts of oil on the trailing edges of the wings and tail of Western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) affected takeoff flight performance. In oiled birds, the distance travelled during the first 0.4??s after takeoff was reduced by 29{\%}, and takeoff angle was decreased by 10?? compared to unoiled birds. Three-axis accelerometry indicated that oiled sandpipers produced less mechanical power output per wingbeat during the initial phase of flight. Slower and lower takeoff would make oiled birds more likely to be targeted and captured by predators, reducing survival and facilitating the exposure of predators to oil. Whereas the direct mortality of heavily-oiled birds is often obvious and can be quantified, our results show that there are significant sub-lethal effects of small amounts crude oil on feathers, which must be considered in natural resource injury assessments for birds.},

abstract = {Hatching strategies are studied in a model of population dynamics in a random environment. The strategies are the fraction of dormant eggs that hatch each year. A projection matrix with random elements describes the population dynamics. The model extends the density- independent model of Dan Cohen and the density-dependent model of Stephen Ellner by adding structure to the egg bank, such that a fraction of the dormant eggs are buried and unavailable for hatching each year. Differences between the structured and unstructured models are analysed by deriving a small variance approximation for the population's long-term growth rate and relating the growth rate to the egg bank structure and the environmental parameters. Tuljapurkar and Istock (1993) claimed that structured and unstructured models give very different predictions, especially when dormancy is high. We show that Tuljapurkar and Istock's conclusions are the result of the particular dormancy type in their model, in which the maximum duration of dormancy is 2 years, rather than the addition of population structure. Using parameters estimated from field and experimental studies of the freshwater copepod Diaptomus sanguineus in Bullhead Pond, RI, the density-dependent model correctly predicts that the population should maintain a long-term pool of diapausing eggs, whereas the density-independent model makes the incorrect prediction that all eggs should hatch at their first opportunity. If the per capita burial and emergence rates are low, as may be the case for many plant populations, the ESS optimal hatching strategy is nearly that of an unstructured model with the mortality of non-hatchers increased by the burial rate.},

abstract = {In birds, accumulating energy is far slower than spending energy during flight. During migration, birds spend, therefore, most of the time at stopover refueling energy used during the previous flight. This elucidates why current energy stores and actual rate of accumulating energy are likely crucial factors influencing birds decision when to resume migration in addition to other intrinsic (sex, age) and extrinsic (predation, weather) factors modulating the decision within the innate migration program. After first summarizing how energy stores and stopover durations are generally determined, we critically review that high-energy stores and low rates of accumulating energy were significantly related to high departure probabilities in several bird groups. There are, however, also many studies showing no effect at all. Recent radio-tracking studies highlighted that migrants leave a site either to resume migration or to search for a better stopover location, so-called landscape movements. Erroneously treating such movements as departures increases the likelihood of type II errors which might mistakenly suggest no effect of either trait on departure. Furthermore, we propose that energy loss during the previous migratory flight in relation to birds current energy stores and migration strategy significantly affects its urge to refuel and hence its departure decision.},

abstract = {In intertidal soft-bottoms, epibenthic predation is one of the most important post-recruitment processes. Small juveniles are particularly susceptible to predation, and they often settle in the high intertidal where predation pressure is relatively low. Growth conditions in the high intertidal are, however, only suboptimal compared to the low intertidal. Juvenile amphipods Leptocheirus pinguis usually remain in their mother's burrow for extended time periods growing to average sizes of 4-6 mm during this extended parental care. In laboratory experiments, more juvenile amphipods survived in controls than in predator additions. In the predator treatments, most adult amphipods survived while many juveniles disappeared. Medium-sized juveniles (6-10 mm size) that had already established their own burrows emigrated in large numbers from the predator treatments whereas most of the adult females remained as residents in these trays. Juvenile L. pinguis survived periods where they are most susceptible to epibenthic predation in the protected burrows of their mother. Extended parental care enables juvenile amphipods to recruit immediately into the adult habitat with a good survival chance. It is hypothesized that some small soft-bottom infauna find protection in the burrows of other infauna, medium-sized infauna is most likely to engage in escape reactions, whereas large infauna build their own, deep, burrows, safe from epibenthic predators.},

abstract = {Optimal migration theory predicts that birds minimizing the overall time of migration should adjust stopover duration with respect to the rate of fuel accu- mulation. Recent theoretical developments also take into account the wind situation and predict that there is a time window (a set of days) during which birds should depart when assisted by winds but will not do so if there are head winds. There is also a final day when birds will de- part irrespective of wind conditions. Hence, the wind model of optimal migration theory predicts that birds should be sensitive to winds and that there should be a correlation between departures and winds blowing to- wards the intended migration direction. We tested this assumption by tracking the departures of radio-tagged passerines during autumn migration in southern Sweden. Our birds were moderately to very fat when released and therefore energetically ready for departure. There was a significant correlation between direction of departure and wind direction. We also found that during days when birds departed there was a significantly larger tail wind component than during days when birds were present but did not depart. Our results show that passerines do take the current wind situation into account when departing on migratory flights. We also briefly discuss possible clues that birds use when estimating wind direction and strength. The inclusion of wind is an important amend- ment to optimal migration theory of birds and should be explored further},

abstract = {During the breeding season, migratory waterfowl are attracted to wetlands characterized by high macroinvertebrate availability. Many of these prairie potholes are fishless and this apparent void is filled, at least partially, by tiger salamanders. Based on gut contents from 98 tiger salamanders and published diet data from over 1500 ducks, we show that there is general overlap in diet between both larval and adult tiger salamanders and 10 duck species. Furthermore, when the ducks were split into foraging guilds and compared with tiger salamanders, prey type overlap was 1.7 times higher and prey size was 1.8 times higher with dabbling ducks than diving ducks. Field surveys show that tiger salamander density is more highly correlated with diving duck density across potholes than dabbling duck density. Tiger salamanders have higher diet overlap with dabbling ducks than diving ducks whereas tiger salamanders have higher spatial overlap with diving ducks than dabbling ducks suggesting that these consumers coarsely partition diet and habitat resources. It has been reported that tiger salamanders have specialized diets that are associated with foraging preferences for benthic habitats. This view is too narrow: in southwestern Manitoba, Canada, tiger salamanders are more general consumers with diets more like dabbling ducks that forage mostly in planktonic and littoral habitats. Our results suggest that dabbling and diving ducks are, to different extents, liable to the effects of indirect interactions, specifically competition for common prey, with tiger salamanders.},

abstract = {There is mounting evidence that parasites can influence the composition and structure of natural animal communities. In spite of this, it is difficult to assess just how important parasitism is for community structure because very few studies have been designed specifically to address the role of parasites at the community level, no doubt because it is difficult to manipulate the abundance of parasites in field experiments. Here, we bring together a large amount of published information on parasitism in intertidal communities to highlight the potential influence of parasites on the structure and biodiversity of these communities. We first review the impact of metazoan parasites on the survival, reproduction, growth and behaviour of intertidal invertebrates, from both rocky shores and soft-sediment flats. Published evidence suggests that the impact of parasites on individuals is often severe, though their effects at the population level are dependent on prevalence and intensity of infection. We then put this information together in a discussion of the impact of parasitism at the community level. We emphasize two ways in which parasites can modify the structure of intertidal communities. First, the direct impact of parasites on the abundance of key host species can decrease the importance of these hosts in competition or predator-prey interactions with other species. Second, the indirect effects of parasites on the behaviour of their hosts, e.g. burrowing ability or spatial distribution within the intertidal zone, can cause changes to various features of the habitat for other intertidal species, leading to their greater settlement success or to their local disappearance. Our synthesis allows specific predictions to be made regarding the potential impact of parasites in certain interridal systems, and suggests that parasites must be included in future community studies and food web models of intertidal ecosystems.},

abstract = {Many migratory birds use staging sites to gain essential resources to fuel their ongoing migration. Understanding staging strategies reveals much about migration systems and is essential if one is concerned with monitoring population trends and mass gains, two of the principal methods for assessing the “health” of a migratory population. In spring 2004, we investigated the staging behavior in Delaware Bay of Red Knot (Calidris canutus) using mark-recapture techniques and resightings of birds marked in the preceding spring. Individuals staged for 11-12 days, which declined to 8-10 days late in the season. Arrivals were asynchronous, but departures tended to be synchronized. A simple sensitivity analysis showed that the mark-recapture analysis estimated length of stay to within +10{\%} and confirmed biases in monitoring trends and mass gains using peak counts and mass-on-date regressions. Alternative methods using staging duration to estimate passage population size and mass gains were shown to be unbiased. Using these methods, we estimated a passage population size in 2004 of 18,000 Red Knot that arrived at an average mass of Ill g and, on average, gained mass at 7.2 g day(-1). Thus, in 2004, the passage population was substantially smaller than the recent peak count of 50,360 in 1998, which confirms a significant decline in the number of Red Knot staging in Delaware Bay. Use of refined techniques such as these is essential if management decisions such as those in Delaware Bay are to be based on firm scientific advice.

abstract = {Overlap was found between habitats of Helice tridens, primarily an occupant of the upper and lower part of the intertidal areas between MTL (mean tidal level) and MHWS (mean high water spring), and H. japonica, usually restricted to the lower part of the intertidal area of the Shigenobu River Estuary, in southwest Japan. While immature individuals and large-sized adults of H. tridens occurred over the intertidal areas, the young adults of H. tridens were found only in the upper part of the intertidal area. This difference in the pattern of distribution between the young adults and the immature individuals of H. tridens seemed to be derived from interspecific competition or intraguild predation between H. tridens and H. japonica and/or intraspecific interactions within each species. These two species have the same of detritivore and carnivore food habits, and conspecific predation within and/or intraguild reciprocal predation between them were frequently observed in the field. In the present study, we performed field caging experiments to examine the dependence of predation ability on size between the two species. When individuals were {\textless}= 7.0 mm carapace width (CW), H. japonica had a higher ability to prey on members of H. tridens of the same size than H. tridens had on those of H. japonica. When individuals were {\textgreater}= 8.0 mm CW, there was no difference between the two species in terms of predatory ability, and the predation rate itself decreased. Therefore, H. japonica can exclude H. tridens from the lower habitats. However, the large sized individuals of H. tridens may intrude into the lower part of the intertidal area from the upper part. They can be against H. japonica, and can prey on the small sized individuals of H. japonica. However, thick sediment set in the cages increased the survival rate of the small individuals of H. japonica, because burrows dug in the sediment could be refuges for those of H. japonica from the intraguild predation by the large sized individuals of H. tridens. These refuges for the small individuals of H. japonica can be refuges also for those of H. tridens. However, burrows cannot be refuges from intraguild predation between similar-sized individuals of two species of the genus Helice. We can conclude that intraguild predation by H. japonica excluded the immature individuals of H. tridens in the lower habitat and restricted the young adults of H. tridens to the upper habitats in the estuary.},

abstract = {It is crucial to study how food resources are allocated in order to understand how invertebrate species of soft-bottomed benthic communities can live in the same environment, especially when belonging to the same trophic level. On the southern shore of the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary, the polychaetes Nereis virens (Nereidae) and Nephtys caeca (Nephtyidae) represent the main infaunal predators and are known to regulate (by predation) other populations within their community. For these animal populations, there is a high degree of spatial overlap in the horizontal dimension as well as vertically in the sediment column. The purpose of this study was to describe and compare the feeding activity of N. virens and N. caeca in relation to several environmental factors. The feeding activity of N. caeca was further studied under natural and experimental conditions and a feeding experiment was carried out to evaluate how the food resource is subdivided in conditions of high spatial overlap. Finally, the prospecting activity of N. virens was described under natural conditions. N. virens and N. caeca exhibited a high degree of dietary overlap, particularly at the adult stage. This food resource overlap can easily influence the regulation of these species, even though they display different feeding responses to environmental stimuli. Tides and storm events can also influence the feeding behaviour. We conclude that different behavioural feeding responses likely favour the occurrence of these two species in the same trophic environment. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many environmental conflicts involve pollutants such as greenhouse gas emissions that are dispersed through space and cause losses of ecosystem services. As pollutant emissions rise in one place, a spatial cascade of declining ecosystem services can spread across a larger landscape because of the dispersion of the pollutant. This paper considers the problem of anticipating such spatial regime shifts by monitoring time series of the pollutant or associated ecosystem services. Using such data, it is possible to construct indicators that rise sharply in advance of regime shifts. Specifically, the maximum eigenvalue of the variance-covariance matrix of the multivariate time series of pollutants and ecosystem services rises prior to the regime shift. No specific knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the regime shift is needed to construct the indicator. Such leading indicators of regime shifts could provide useful signals to management agencies or to investors in ecosystem service markets.},

abstract = {1. A number of terrestrial bird species that breed in North America
cross the Atlantic Ocean during autumn migration when travelling to
their non-breeding grounds in the Caribbean or South America. When
conducting oceanic crossings, migratory birds tend to associate with
mild or supportive winds, whose speed and direction may change under
global warming. The implications of these changes for transoceanic
migratory bird populations have not been addressed.
2. We used occurrence information from eBird (1950-2015) to estimate the
geographical location of population centres at a daily temporal
resolution across the annual cycle for 10 transatlantic migratory bird
species. We used this information to estimate the location and timing of
autumn migration within the transatlantic flyway. We estimated how
prevailing winds are projected to change within the transatlantic flyway
during this time using daily wind speed anomalies (1996-2005 and
2091-2100) from 29 Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models
implemented under CMIP5.
3. Autumn transatlantic migrants have the potential to encounter strong
westerly crosswinds early in their transatlantic journey at intermediate
and especially high migration altitudes, strong headwinds at low and
intermediate migration altitudes within the Caribbean that increase in
strength as the season progresses, and weak tailwinds at intermediate
and high migration altitudes east of the Caribbean. The CMIP5
simulations suggest that, during this century, the likelihood of autumn
transatlantic migrants encountering strong westerly crosswinds will
diminish.
4. As global warming progresses, the need for species to compensate or
drift under the influence of strong westerly crosswinds during the
initial phase of their autumn transatlantic journey may be diminished.
Existing strategies that promote headwind avoidance and tailwind
assistance will likely remain valid. Thus, climate change may reduce
time and energy requirements and the chance of mortality or vagrancy
during a specific but likely critical portion of these species' autumn
migration journey.},

abstract = {Population indices quantify changes in relative population sizes, which underpin much of basic ecology and conservation science. However, temporal changes in population counts may vary among survey sites for both ecological and artificial reasons, confounding existing population indices estimated without accounting for such variations. We created a smoothed hierarchical model, and compared its performance against the conventional approaches (generalized linear models and generalized additive models) and a non-smoothed hierarchical model using simulation data with a known nonlinear trend. The smoothed hierarchical model always estimated population indices with the best accuracy and precision; the performance of other models deteriorated substantially with increasing variation in trends of population counts among sites, causing inaccurate estimation of population growth rates. The estimated variations in trends of population counts among sites for 233 out of 518 North American breeding bird species were larger than the value used in the simulation where there was a considerable difference in the performance between hierarchical models and the conventional approaches. These estimated variations in trends of population counts among sites were particularly large in gregarious waterbirds. These results suggest that the smoothed hierarchical model developed in this study should play an important role in accurately assessing population indices, particularly for gregarious waterbirds, using count data from large-scale, long-term surveys in the field.},

@phdthesis{Pomeroy2006a,
abstract = {Migrant birds face a tradeoff at stopover sites between acquiring resources to fuel migration and avoiding predators. This tradeoff is crucial because the rapid acquisition of high-energy fuel for long-distance flight requires feeding in high-resource habitats, feeding intensely, and carrying heavy loads of fat, all of which elevate predation danger. I investigated how migrant western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) trade off food and safety at both the site (within stopover) and landscape (among stopovers) scales. I studied within-site usage by sandpipers at Boundary Bay, located in the Strait of Georgia, in southwestern British Columbia. The mudflat is characterized by a strong feeding-danger gradient, with both food and danger decreasing with distance from the shoreline. I measured dropping densities on transects to evaluate how sandpipers distributed their usage across the mudflat. Dropping densities peaked at intermediate distances from shore, showing that sandpipers maximized neither energy gain (highest close to shore), nor safety (greatest far from shore). The observed pattern is that expected if these factors are traded off against each other. To test this hypothesis experimentally, I manipulating danger by adding obstructive cover to the open mudflat. As predicted, usage was lower on obstruction transects than controls; the difference in usage between control and obstruction transects was greatest near the obstruction; declined with distance from the obstruction; and was greater where food abundance was lower. Western sandpipers were also captured on noose carpets spread across these transects, which revealed that usage was mass -dependent: heavy individuals fed far from shore. A dynamic state variable model incorporating trade off assumptions predicted all of these patterns. I investigated whether similar considerations applied at the landscape scale. Of 17 potential stopover sites for sandpipers in the Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound, only 8 were used on migration. Consideration of both food and safety better predicted stopover site usage than either factor alone. Furthermore, heavy sandpipers predominated at safe stopover sites, while leaner birds used more dangerous sites. This thesis highlights the importance of the interaction between food abundance and danger from predators in studies of stopover site behaviour, usage, and site selection by migrant birds.},

Using linear regression and additive modelling in R we dis- cuss key issues such as interactions, model selection, model validation, and model interpretation. We do not deal with the underlying theory of linear regression and additive modelling in this appendix as this is discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. To illustrate the linear regression model, we use bird data originally analysed in Loyn (1987), and again in Quinn and Keough (2002). This data set is especially good for introducing linear regression and extensions like additive modelling.},

abstract = {Prey can use alarm calls to indicate the presence of a predator in social groups. However, how does it work in species that do not produce such signals? We investigated how detection of a threat occurred in groups of kangaroos. We showed that detectors, through their vigilant posture, provided information about the threat to other close group members and reactions proceeded sequentially like a domino effect. Collective detection thus appears not to be restricted to social species that exhibit conspicuous alarm signals.Although collective detection plays a key role in determining individual survival, few studies have carefully examined the collective process of detection. We investigated collective detection in the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), a species that forages in temporary groups and rarely produces auditory alarm signals on detection. In experimental trials, we exposed one group member to a predation threat (a python, Morelia spilota) that its companions could only detect indirectly by observing the reaction of the detector. We videotaped these and control trials in which individuals were not exposed to the python and focal females simply used vigilance routinely. Our aims were to 1) examine whether collective detection occurred and, if so, 2) investigate the temporal pattern of the information transfer among individuals. The latencies between the focal females first scans and those of their 4 neighbors were shorter in the exposed than those in the control groups. The latencies between successive individuals scans were on average shorter in the exposed groups and at the beginning of the reaction chain, and interindividual distances acted to constrain information transfer. More individuals became vigilant in the exposed than in the control groups. Thus, detection of the snake by focal females provided information about a potential threat to other close group members and reactions to this initial detection proceeded sequentially like a domino effect. Collective detection thus is not restricted to social species that exhibit conspicuous alarm signals.},

abstract = {During modern birds history, climatic and environmental conditions have evolved on wide scales. In a continuously changing world, landbirds annual migrations emerged and developed. However, models accounting for the origins of these avian migrations were formulated with static ecogeographic perspectives. Here I reviewed Cenozoic paleoclimatic and paleontological data relative to the palearctic-paleotropical long distance (LD) migration system. This led to propose a new model for the origin of LD migrations, the 'shifting home' model (SHM). It is based on a dynamic perspective of climate evolution and may apply to the origins of most modern migrations. Non-migrant tropical African bird taxa were present at European latitudes during most of the Cenozoic. Their distribution limits shifted progressively toward modern tropical latitudes during periods of global cooling and increasing seasonality. In parallel, decreasing winter temperatures in the western Palearctic drove shifts of population winter ranges toward the equator. I propose that this induced the emergence of most short distance migrations, and in turn LD migrations. This model reconciliates ecologically tropical ancestry of most LD migrants with predominant winter range shifts, in accordance with requirements for heritable homing. In addition, it is more parsimonious than other non-exclusive models. Greater intrinsic plasticity of winter ranges implied by the SHM is supported by recently observed impacts of the present global warming on migrating birds. This may induce particular threats to some LD migrants. The ancestral, breeding homes of LD migrants were not 'northern' or 'southern' but shifted across high and middle latitudes while migrations emerged through winter range shifts themselves.},

abstract = {We describe a method for estimating the total number of shorebirds that use a migration stopover site during spring and fall migration. We combined weekly shorebird counts with parameter estimates for detection probability, sampled proportion, and length of stay on the Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge. Double sampling was used to determine detection probability and estimated values varied among wetland units from a low of 0.07 to a high of 0.82. The sampled proportion of most wetland units was 100{\%} but was lower in some of the larger units. Length of stay (measured for Pectoral [Calidris melanotos] and Least Sandpipers [C. minutilla] combined) averaged 10.0 days in spring and 3.7 days in fall. Spring shorebird numbers were approximately five times greater than fall numbers on the Refuge. Annual shorebird numbers varied among years from an estimated low in 2003 of 15 734 to a high in 2002 of 69 570. Peak daily counts during study years averaged only 12{\%} of estimated spring totals and 4{\%} of fall totals. An estimate of shorebird numbers based on summing weekly counts, not corrected for detection probability or sampled proportion, would have been only 21{\%} (spring) to 31{\%} (fall) of the total number of birds. These results reveal that peak counts and nonadjusted counts can significantly underestimate the number of shorebirds that use migration stopover sites in the midcontinent of North America.},

abstract = {Time-minimizing migrants should leave a stopover site if the instantaneous speed of migration drops to the average speed of migration in the environment. This argument has been used in two different ways: either there is local variation in the fuel deposition rate and a fixed expected speed or there is global variation in the fuel deposition rate, i.e. locally experienced variation represents global variation along the route. The first case leads to a far steeper relationship between departure load and fuel deposition rate than the second case. So far, data on departure loads have mainly been analysed within the concept of local variation of the fuel deposition rate and the result that the observed slopes are much lower than predicted has been explained by changes in the expected speed along the route or by individual differences in the expected speed. We show here that the observed relationships generally fall close to the predictions for global variation. We propose that migrants use a behavioural rule which projects the current experience into the future and therefore interprets local variation as global variation.},

abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) will greatly alter littoral ecosystems, causing habitat change and loss for coastal species. Habitat loss is widely used as a measurement of the risk of extinction, but because many coastal species are migratory, the impact of habitat loss will depend not only on its extent, but also on where it occurs. Here, we develop a novel graph-theoretic approach to measure the vulnerability of a migratory network to the impact of habitat loss from SLR based on population flow through the network. We show that reductions in population flow far exceed the proportion of habitat lost for 10 long-distance migrant shorebirds using the East Asian–Australasian Flyway. We estimate that SLR will inundate 23–40{\%} of intertidal habitat area along their migration routes, but cause a reduction in population flow of up to 72 per cent across the taxa. This magnifying effect was particularly strong for taxa whose migration routes contain bottlenecks—sites through which a large fraction of the population travels. We develop the bottleneck index, a new network metric that positively correlates with the predicted impacts of habitat loss on overall population flow. Our results indicate that migratory species are at greater risk than previously realized.},

abstract = {Northbound migrant shorebirds (Charadridae and Scolopacidae) were surveyed weekly by air on Delaware Bay beaches on the Atlantic coast of North America in May-June 1986 through 1992. The single day peak count occurred between 26030 May when an average of more than 216,000 birds was counted. The most abundant species were semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla), ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres), red knot (Calidris canutus), and sanderling (Calidris alba). Our surveys documented high hemispheric counts for each of these speices, and established Delaware Bay as the most important spring stopover in the eastern U.S. for these shorebirds. Counts of sanderlings and semipalmated sandpipers declined significantly over the seven years; no trends for other species were detected. Differences amond species in distribution along bay beaches were attributable partly to habitat factors. We suggest that a thorough understanding of shorebird abundance and habitat use in Delaware Bay is necessary to develop a conservation strategy for regulatory protection and conservation of migrant shorebirds using this area.},

abstract = {Abstract We examined biotic and abiotic variables on the expansive intertidal mudflats of the upper Bay of Fundy, Canada, at 8 geographically separate sites over 2 years (2009–2011). Invertebrate density, surface density of primary producers (mainly diatoms, measured as chlorophyll-a concentration), shorebird- and fish-foraging activity, and sediment properties varied considerably through time and space. Dissimilarity in the invertebrate community between consecutive sampling rounds was lower during peaks in density and richness (June–August) than during periods of low density and richness (December–March). All but one site located within Chignecto Bay (one arm of the upper Bay of Fundy) had similar invertebrate communities; sites within the Minas Basin (the other arm of the upper Bay) had more distinct communities compared to Chignecto Bay mudflats. The amphipod Corophium volutator, Copepoda, Ostracoda, and the polychaetes Phyllodocidae and Spionidae were usually main contributors to observed community d...},

abstract = {Birds of prey have been, in comparison to other avian groups, an uncommon study model, mainly due to the limitations imposed by their conservative life strategy (low population density and turnover). Nonetheless, they have attracted a strong interest from the point of view of conservation biology because many populations have been close to extinction and because of their recognised role in ecosystems as top predators and scavengers and as flagship species. Today, after more than a century of persecution, and with the exception of some vultures still very much affected by illegal poisoning, many populations of birds of prey have experienced significant recoveries in many regions of Spain and the European Mediterranean. These changes pose new challenges when addressing the conservation of raptors in the coming decades. On this basis, and from a preferentially Mediterranean perspective, we have focused our attention on the need of describing and quantifying the role of these birds as providers of both regulating (rodent pest control and removal of livestock carcasses) and cultural ecosystem services. Moreover, we revisited persisting conflicts with human interests (predation of game species) and call attention to the emergence of new conflicts with a strong social and media component such as the predation on live cattle by vultures. Also, the rampant humanization of the environment determines the need for new solutions to the growing, yet scarcely explored, problem of accidents in new infrastructures such as mortality in wind farms. Finally, we explored in depth the ecological response of birds of prey to large-scale habitat changes such as urbanisation and abandonment of marginal lands that are also expected to increase in the near future. We urgently need more scientific knowledge to provide adequate responses to the challenge of keeping healthy populations of avian predators and scavengers in a rapidly changing world.},

abstract = {A classic textbook example of adaptive radiation under natural selection is the evolution of 14 closely related species of Darwin's finches (Fringillidae, Passeriformes), whose primary diversity lies in the size and shape of their beaks. Thus, ground finches have deep and wide beaks, cactus finches have long and pointed beaks (low depth and narrower width), and warbler finches have slender and pointed beaks, reflecting differences in their respective diets. Previous work has shown that even small differences in any of the three major dimensions (depth, width and length) of the beak have major consequences for the overall fitness of the birds. Recently we used a candidate gene approach to explain one pathway involved in Darwin's finch beak morphogenesis. However, this type of analysis is limited to molecules with a known association with craniofacial and/or skeletogenic development. Here we use a less constrained, complementary DNA microarray analysis of the transcripts expressed in the beak primordia to find previously unknown genes and pathways whose expression correlates with specific beak morphologies. We show that calmodulin (CaM), a molecule involved in mediating Ca2+ signalling, is expressed at higher levels in the long and pointed beaks of cactus finches than in more robust beak types of other species. We validated this observation with in situ hybridizations. When this upregulation of the CaM-dependent pathway is artificially replicated in the chick frontonasal prominence, it causes an elongation of the upper beak, recapitulating the beak morphology of the cactus finches. Our results indicate that local upregulation of the CaM-dependent pathway is likely to have been a component of the evolution of Darwin's finch species with elongated beak morphology and provide a mechanistic explanation for the independence of beak evolution along different axes. More generally, our results implicate the CaM-dependent pathway in the developmental regulation of craniofacial skeletal structures.},

abstract = {An experiment was designed to assess the role of 2 different predators in determining the macrobenthic community structure of an intertidal sandflat, The 2 predators were: shorebirds which feed throughout the year by removing individual prey items, and eagle rays Myliobatis tenuicaudatus which are only present during the summer and disturb large volumes of sediment where extracting prey. The experiment consisted of bird exclusion, ray + bird exclusion and reference plots. Samples were collected from each plot on 2 occasions: 6 mo after the initiation of the experiment, when rays were absent and common bivalve densities were high following recruitment, and 8 mo later when rays were present and bivalve population structure was not dominated by new recruits. At the end of the experiment analysis of surficial sediment features did not indicate the experiment was confounded by localised modifications of sediment or hydrodynamic conditions. Community level differences on both occasions were driven by effects on common taxa. The seasonality of effects in our experiment precluded direct comparison of the 2 predators. However, the 6 mo results indicated that bird predation resulted in indirect effects due to adult/juvenile interactions amongst the dominant bivalve Macomona liliana. At the end of the experiment, 14 mo after its initiation, analysis of common taxa generally revealed direct negative effects of predation, with significantly high densities in the ray + bird exclusion treatment. Infaunal density changes in response to the exclusion of shorebirds and rays did not indicate the presence of multiple trophic levels in this infaunal assemblage. Differences between the results obtained from the bird exclusion and the ray + bird exclusion treatments on the first sampling occasion were attributed to an edge effect around the bird exclusion plots which effectively increased their area. This edge effect emphasises the importance of infaunal mobility and its potential to swamp predator effects. The results of this experiment highlight the importance of considering the role of predators within an appropriate spatial and temporal context.},

abstract = {The propensity of migratory waders to remain on the non-breeding grounds during the arctic breeding season ("oversummer") in their first biological year of life ("juveniles") may be latitude, and thus migratory distance dependent. We compared the extent of preparation for northward migration of western sandpipers Calidris mouri spending the non-breeding season in Mexico and Panama during 1995-1998. During winter residency and premigratory periods, we measured body mass and scored the extent of dull basic versus bright alternate breeding plumage of captured juveniles and adults (second biological year or older), and obtained additional plumage scores from observations of uniquely colour banded birds. Nearly all western sandpipers in Mexico prepared for northward migration by increasing body mass and moulting into breeding Plumage. In Panama. most adults prepared for migration, but few, if any., juveniles did so. Patterns of body mass and breeding plumage development do not generally support the hypothesis that oversummering by juveniles results directly from less efficient foraging or from resource competition with adults. We suggest instead that costs directly associated with migratory distance per se influence the life history strategies of sandpipers spending the non-breeding seasons at different latitudes. This latitudinal difference should interact with the well documented sex-ratio cline in non-breeding distribution (male western sandpipers predominating in northern parts of the range and females in Southern parts). This Suggests that females have more conservative life histories, prioritizing first year survivorship, relative to males that instead weight first-year breeding opportunities.},

abstract = {Besides the "normal" challenge of obtaining adequate intake rates in a patchy and dangerous world, shorebirds foraging in intertidal habitats face additional environmental hurdles. The tide forces them to commute between a roosting site and feeding grounds, twice a day. Moreover, because intertidal food patches are not all available at the same time, shorebirds should follow itineraries along the best patches available at a given time. Finally, shorebirds need additional energy stores in order to survive unpredictable periods of bad weather, during which food patches are covered by extreme tides. In order to model such tide-specific decisions, we applied stochastic dynamic programming in a spatially explicit context. Two assumptions were varied, leading to four models. First, birds had either perfect (ideal) or no (non-ideal) information about the intake rate at each site. Second, traveling between sites was either for free or incurred time and energy costs (non-free). Predictions were generated for three aspects of foraging: area use, foraging routines, and energy stores. In general, non-ideal foragers should feed most intensely and should maintain low energy stores. If traveling for such birds is free, they should feed at a random site; otherwise, they should feed close to their roost. Ideal foragers should concentrate their feeding around low tide (especially when free) and should maintain larger energy stores (especially when non-free). If traveling for such birds is free, they should feed at the site offering the highest intake rate; otherwise, they should trade off travel costs and intake rate. Models were parameterized for Red Knots (Calidris canutus) living in the Dutch Wadden Sea in late summer, an area for which detailed, spatially explicit data on prey densities and tidal heights are available. Observations of radio-marked knots (area use) and unmarked knots (foraging routines, energy stores) showed the closest match with the ideal/non-free model. We conclude that knots make state-dependent decisions by trading off starvation against foraging-associated risks, including predation. Presumably, knots share public information about resource quality that enables them to behave in a more or less ideal manner. We suggest that our modeling approach may be applicable in other systems where resources fluctuate in space and time.},

abstract = {Determining appropriate statistical distributions for modeling animal count data is important for accurate estimation of abundance, distribution, and trends. In the case of sea ducks along the U.S. Atlantic coast, managers want to estimate local and regional abundance to detect and track population declines, to define areas of high and low use, and to predict the impact of future habitat change on populations. In this paper, we used a modified marked point process to model survey data that recorded flock sizes of Common eiders, Long-tailed ducks, and Black, Surf, and White-winged scoters. The data come from an experimental aerial survey, conducted by the United States Fish {\&} Wildlife Service (USFWS) Division of Migratory Bird Management, during which east-west transects were flown along the Atlantic Coast from Maine to Florida during the winters of 2009-2011. To model the number of flocks per transect (the points), we compared the fit of four statistical distributions (zero-inflated Poisson, zero-inflated geometric, zero-inflated negative binomial and negative binomial) to data on the number of species-specific sea duck flocks that were recorded for each transect flown. To model the flock sizes (the marks), we compared the fit of flock size data for each species to seven statistical distributions: positive Poisson, positive negative binomial, positive geometric, logarithmic, discretized lognormal, zeta and Yule-Simon. Akaike's Information Criterion and Vuong's closeness tests indicated that the negative binomial and discretized lognormal were the best distributions for all species for the points and marks, respectively. These findings have important implications for estimating sea duck abundances as the discretized lognormal is a more skewed distribution than the Poisson and negative binomial, which are frequently used to model avian counts; the lognormal is also less heavy-tailed than the power law distributions (e.g., zeta and Yule-Simon), which are becoming increasingly popular for group size modeling. Choosing appropriate statistical distributions for modeling flock size data is fundamental to accurately estimating population summaries, determining required survey effort, and assessing and propagating uncertainty through decision-making processes.},

abstract = {Corticosterone (CORT) is seasonally modulated in many passerines, with plasma CORT concentrations lowest during the prebasic molt when all feathers are replaced. To explain why, we proposed that the birds downregulate natural CORT release during molt in order to avoid CORT's degradative effects on proteins and its inhibition of protein synthesis. If CORT exerted these effects during molt, it could slow protein deposition during feather production and potentially result in a longer period of degraded flight performance. To test this hypothesis, either empty or CORT-filled silastic implants were inserted into captive European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) undergoing induced (feather replacement after plucking) and natural molts. We then measured the rate of feather re-growth by regularly measuring the length of primary, secondary, and tail feathers. CORT implanted birds showed a significantly decreased rate of feather growth compared to control animals. Basal CORT concentrations of induced molt and non-molting birds were also compared but no difference was noted. The results suggest a tradeoff; a complete set of new feathers may be more important to the survival of a bird than the ability of CORT to respond maximally to a stressor. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In estuaries hosting both wintering and migrating populations of waders of the same species, the distinct ecological constraints on birds in different seasons may result in different criteria being used for selection of suitable foraging habitat. We analysed the distribution patterns of dunlins Calidris alpina in the Tagus estuary, Portugal, during the non-breeding season and investigated the roles of prey availability and predation risk to explain those patterns. The southern estuary provided higher prey availability but their narrower flats may induce greater fear of predation in waders than the open northern flats. However, our data suggest that the real risk was similar. Migrating birds avoided the southern estuary, favouring areas perceived as safer over better feeding opportunities. In contrast, wintering dunlins favoured the southern flats, despite their proximity to cover. Presumably, wintering waders have a better knowl- edge of the estuary, including its real predation risks, taking advantage of the best foraging areas.

abstract = {Preventing a pest population from damaging an agricultural crop and, at the same time, preventing the development of pesticide resistance is a major challenge in crop protection. Understanding how farming practices and environmental factors interact with pest characteristics to influence the spread of resistance is a difficult and complex task. It is extremely challenging to investigate such interactions experimentally at realistic spatial and temporal scales. Mathematical modelling and computer simulation have, therefore, been used to analyse resistance evolution and to evaluate potential resistance management tactics. Of the many modelling approaches available, individual-based modelling of a pest population offers most flexibility to include and analyse numerous factors and their interactions. Here, a pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus) population was modelled as an aggregate of individual insects inhabiting a spatially heterogeneous landscape. The development of the pest and host crop (oilseed rape) was driven by climatic variables. The agricultural land of the landscape was managed by farmers applying a specific rotation and crop protection strategy. The evolution of a single resistance allele to the pyrethroid lambda cyhalothrin was analysed for different combinations of crop management practices and for a recessive, intermediate and dominant resistance allele. While the spread of a recessive resistance allele was severely constrained, intermediate or dominant resistance alleles showed a similar response to the management regime imposed. Calendar treatments applied irrespective of pest density accelerated the development of resistance compared to ones applied in response to prescribed pest density thresholds. A greater proportion of spring-sown oilseed rape was also found to increase the speed of resistance as it increased the period of insecticide exposure. Our study demonstrates the flexibility and power of an individual-based model to simulate how farming practices affect pest population dynamics, and the consequent impact of different control strategies on the risk and speed of resistance development.},

Many prevalent models of social foraging assume that foraging and scanning are mutually exclusive. Although this assumption is valid for birds with narrow visual fields, these models have also been applied to species with wide fields. In fact, available models do not make precise predictions for birds with large visual fields, in which the head-up, head-down dichotomy is not accurate and, moreover, do not consider the effects of detection distance and limited attention. Studies of how different types of visual information are acquired as a function of body posture and of how information flows within flocks offer new insights into the costs and benefits of living in groups.},

abstract = {Arctic amplification, the accelerated climate warming in the polar regions, is causing a more rapid advancement of the onset of spring in the Arctic than in temperate regions. Consequently, the arrival of many migratory birds in the Arctic is thought to become increasingly mismatched with the onset of local spring, consequently reducing individual fitness and potentially even population levels. We used a dynamic state variable model to study whether Arctic long-distance migrants can advance their migratory schedules under climate warming scenarios which include Arctic amplification, and whether such an advancement is constrained by fuel accumulation or the ability to anticipate climatic changes. Our model predicts that barnacle geese Branta leucopsis suffer from considerably reduced reproductive success with increasing Arctic amplification through mistimed arrival, when they cannot anticipate a more rapid progress of Arctic spring from their wintering grounds. When geese are able to anticipate a more rapid progress of Arctic spring, they are predicted to advance their spring arrival under Arctic amplification up to 44 days without any reproductive costs in terms of optimal condition or timing of breeding. Negative effects of mistimed arrival on reproduction are predicted to be somewhat mitigated by increasing summer length under warming in the Arctic, as late arriving geese can still breed successfully. We conclude that adaptation to Arctic amplification may rather be constrained by the (un)predictability of changes in the Arctic spring than by the time available for fuel accumulation. Social migrants like geese tend to have a high behavioural plasticity regarding stopover site choice and migration schedule, giving them the potential to adapt to future climate changes on their flyway. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer-Verlag Berlin HeidelbergMigrating birds are known to fly non-stop for thousands of kilometres without food or water intake and at a high metabolic rate thereby relying on energy stores which were built up preceding a flight bout. Hence, from a physiological point of view the metabolism of a migrant has to switch between an active fasting phase during flight and a fuelling phase during stopover. To meet the energetic and water requirements of endurance flight, migratory birds have to store an optimal fuel composition and they have to be able to quickly mobilize and deliver sufficient energy to the working flight muscles. After flight, birds have to recover from a strenuous exercise and sleeplessness, but, at the same time, they have to be alert to escape from predators and to prepare the next flight bout. In this overview, metabolic adaptations of free-ranging migrants to both phases will be presented and compared with results from windtunnel studies. The questions whether migratory strategy (long distance versus short distance) and diet composition influence the metabolic pathways will be discussed.},

abstract = {Worldwide declines in shorebird populations, driven largely by habitat loss and degradation, motivate environmental managers to preserve and restore the critical coastal habitats on which these birds depend. Effective habitat management requires an understanding of the factors that determine habitat use and value to shorebirds, extending from individuals to the entire community. While investigating the factors that influenced shorebird foraging distributions among neighboring intertidal sand flats, we built upon species-level understandings of individual-based, small-scale foraging decisions to develop more comprehensive guild-and community-level insights. We found that densities and community composition of foraging shorebirds varied substantially among elevations within some tidal flats and among five flats despite their proximity (all located within a 400-m stretch of natural, unmodified inlet shoreline). Non-dimensional multivariate analyses revealed that the changing composition of the shorebird community among flats and tidal elevations correlated significantly (rho(s) = 0.56) with the spatial structure of the benthic invertebrate prey community. Sediment grain-sizes affected shorebird community spatial patterns indirectly by influencing benthic macroinvertebrate community compositions. Furthermore, combining sediment and macroinvertebrate information produced a 27{\%} increase in correlation (rho(s) = 0.71) with shorebird assemblage patterns over the correlation of the bird community with the macroinvertebrate community alone. Beyond its indirect effects acting through prey distributions, granulometry of the flats influenced shorebird foraging directly by modifying prey availability. Our study highlights the importance of habitat heterogeneity, showing that no single patch type was ideal for the entire shorebird community. Generally, shorebird density and diversity were greatest at lower elevations on flats when they became exposed; these areas are at risk from human intervention by inlet sand mining, construction of groins and jetties that divert sediments from flats, and installation of seawalls on inlet shorelines that induce erosion of flats.},

abstract = {The influence of predation risk on patch choice was measured by examining the spatial distribution of 10 guppies (Poecilia reticulata) between two feeders, at one of which there was a risk of predation. The distribution was assumed to be ideal free. Nine unique situations were examined using all possible combinations of three risk levels and three diet levels, for each sex of guppy separately. Both sex and diet level influenced the effect of predation risk on patch choice. For the females the effect of risk was highest at the intermediate diet level. However, the males exhibited the opposite response: the effect of risk of predation was lowest at the intermediate diet level. A simple equation was then used to predict how much extra food (representing the energetic equivalent of risk) must be added to the risky patch for the guppies to become indifferent to the risk differences between the two types of patches. This manipulation caused a similar number of guppies to use both the risky and safe feeders, reducing or offsetting the influence of risk of predation. However, the male guppies were less influenced by this manipulation than were the females. The different results for the two sexes are consistent with known differences in their life histories, indicating that a knowledge of an animal's life history will often be necessary to understand how it makes trade-offs when choosing were to forage.},

abstract = {Studies of phenotypic plasticity frequently ask how organisms respond to a change in their environment, but most organisms do not experience single environmental changes. Therefore, we need to move to the next step and understand how organisms respond to combinations of environmental changes. Recent studies of predator-induced plasticity have addressed how prey respond to different combinations of predators. I briefly review 22 studies of combined predator effects on prey phenotypes and identify four factors that make it difficult to interpret the results of these studies: (1) uncontrolled prey consumption, (2) a low number of prey traits, (3) a low number of predator combinations, and (4) confounded predator composition and total predator density. I address these challenges in an experiment that examined how wood frog tadpoles (Rana sylvatica) altered 12 behavioral, morphological, and life historical traits in response to four different caged predators (Erythemis, Belostoma, Dytiscus, and Anax). The predators were present alone at low density, alone at high density (2X), or combined into six pairwise combinations. When each predator was alone (at either low or high density), tadpoles discriminated among different predators and produced predator-specific phenotypes. The doubling of predator density rarely induced more extreme prey phenotypes. When predators were combined, the tadpoles generally developed phenotypes that were similar to those induced by the more risky predator alone (90{\%} of all traits examined, at either low or high density). These results suggest that tadpoles perceive the risk of combined predators as being similar to the risk of the most dangerous predator in the pair, and not as a summed or averaged predation risk. The actual risk from these predator combinations remains to be tested. This appears to be the first study to take a comprehensive approach that controls prey consumption, examines a large number of prey traits, uses a large number of predator combinations, and separates the effects of predator composition and predator density. There is a clear need for more such studies to determine whether these results can be generalized to other taxa.},

abstract = {Our understanding of migratory birds' year-round ecology and evolution remains patchy despite recent fundamental advances. Periodic reviews focus future research and inform conservation and management; here, we take advantage of our combined experiences working on Western Hemisphere avian migration systems to highlight recent lessons and critical gaps in knowledge. Among topics discussed are: (1) The pipeline from pure to applied researchers leaves room for improvement. (2) Population limitation and regulation includes both seasonal and between-season interactions. (3) The study of movements of small-bodied species remains a major research frontier. (4) We must increase our understanding of population connectivity. (5) With few exceptions, population regulation has barely been investigated. (6) We have increasingly integrated landscape configuration of habitats, large-scale habitat disturbances, and habitat quality impacts into models of seasonal and overall demographic success. (7) The post-breeding season (late summer for latitudinal migrants) is increasingly appreciated for its impacts on demography. (8) We recognize the diverse ways that avian brood parasites, nest predators, and food availability affect demography. (9) Source-sink and meta-population models help us understand migratory avian distributions among fragmented habitats. (10) Advances in modeling have improved estimates of annual survival and fecundity, but for few species. (11) Populations can be limited by ecological conditions in winter, but habitat needs are poorly known for most species at this time. (12) Migration tends to occupy broad spatial fronts that may change seasonally or when migrants cross major barriers. (13) En route conditions can limit migrant populations; linking migration habitat quality indicators to fitness or population consequences presents a major challenge. (14) A variety of intra-tropical Neotropical migration patterns are recognizable,. but almost nothing is known about these systems beyond descriptions of a few typical species' movements. (15) Global climate change scenarios predict range and phenology shifts of Neotropical migrant bird populations that must be considered in conservation plans. Future studies will depend on new technologies and the integration of modeling with sophisticated, large-spatial-scale measurement and parameter estimation; whether the pace of research and management involving migratory birds can match the growth of environmental threats remains to be seen.},

abstract = {Based on theory, we predicted that males, but not females, of the intertidal amphipod, Corophium volutator (Pallas), would show variation in crawling activity in relation to risk of sandpiper predation. We chose two mudflats in the upper Bay of Fundy for study. One mudflat was visited by thousands of semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla L.) in the late summers; the other mudflat was not visited by sandpipers. As predicted, we found that only males showed reductions in their crawling activity and only at the mudflat visited by sandpipers. Moreover, temporal and experimentally-produced spatial variation in feeding activity of sandpipers at that mudflat was closely associated with temporal and spatial variation in male crawling activity. Direct predation by sandpipers could not account for the drastic reductions in crawling activity of males. That flexible behaviour exists in this species and is restricted to one sex is intriguing. Although our results support the theory on evolution of flexible behaviour, we are still uncertain of the extent to which flexible behaviour influences known demographical differences between subpopulations of C. volutator.},

abstract = {The migratory shorebirds of the East Atlantic flyway land in huge numbers during a migratory stopover or wintering on the French Atlantic coast. The Brouage bare mudflat (Marennes-Ol{\'{e}}ron Bay, NE Atlantic) is one of the major stopover sites in France. The particular structure and function of a food web affects the efficiency of carbon transfer. The structure and functioning of the Brouage food web is crucial for the conservation of species landing within this area because it provides sufficient food, which allows shorebirds to reach the north of Europe where they nest. The aim of this study was to describe and understand which food web characteristics support nutritional needs of birds. Two food-web models were constructed, based on in situ measurements that were made in February 2008 (the presence of birds) and July 2008 (absence of birds). To complete the models, allometric relationships and additional data from the literature were used. The missing flow values of the food web models were estimated by Monte Carlo Markov Chain--Linear Inverse Modelling. The flow solutions obtained were used to calculate the ecological network analysis indices, which estimate the emergent properties of the functioning of a food-web. The total activities of the Brouage ecosystem in February and July are significantly different. The specialisation of the trophic links within the ecosystem does not appear to differ between the two models. In spite of a large export of carbon from the primary producer and detritus in winter, the higher recycling leads to a similar retention of carbon for the two seasons. It can be concluded that in February, the higher activity of the ecosystem coupled with a higher cycling and a mean internal organization, ensure the sufficient feeding of the migratory shorebirds.},

abstract = {— Risk factors for predation attempts by Peregrine Falcons ( Falco peregrinus ) were examined in Semi- palmated Sandpipers ( Calidris pusilla ) during fall staging in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Odds of attacks may be ex- pected to vary with a host of factors such as time of day, time of year, spacing within groups and weather conditions. During the ebbing tide, 65 surprise attacks by falcons were recorded over 596 observation periods. Two factors emerged as risk factors for predation attempts by Peregrine Falcons on Semipalmated Sandpiper flocks during four consecutive fall staging periods. Falcons initiated attacks more often on denser flocks and later during the migra- tory stopover. Year, time of day and weather factors did not influence attack rate. These findings may reflect lower anti-predator vigilance in denser groups and the greater numbers of sandpipers available in the later stages of stop- over. Fitness consequences of these attacks remain to be established.},

abstract = {Various ecological and other complex dynamical systems may exhibit abrupt regime shifts or critical transitions, wherein they reorganize from one stable state to another over relatively short time scales. Because of potential losses to ecosystem services, forecasting such unexpected shifts would be valuable. Using mathematical models of regime shifts, ecologists have proposed various early warning signals of imminent shifts. However, their generality and applicability to real ecosystems remain unclear because these mathematical models are considered too simplistic. Here, we investigate the robustness of recently proposed early warning signals of regime shifts in two well-studied ecological models, but with the inclusion of time-delayed processes. We find that the average variance may either increase or decrease prior to a regime shift and, thus, may not be a robust leading indicator in time-delayed ecological systems. In contrast, changing average skewness, increasing autocorrelation at short time lags, and reddening power spectra of time series of the ecological state variable all show trends consistent with those of models with no time delays. Our results provide insights into the robustness of early warning signals of regime shifts in a broader class of ecological systems.},

abstract = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 464–472AbstractPredicting regime shifts – drastic changes in dynamic behaviour – is a key challenge in ecology and other fields. Here we show that the class of ecological systems that will exhibit leading indicators of regime shifts is limited, and that there is a set of ecological models and, therefore, also likely to be a class of natural systems for which there will be no forewarning of a regime change. We first describe how nonlinearities in combination with environmental variability lead to model descriptions that will not have smooth potentials, concluding that many ecological systems are described by systems without smooth potentials and thus will not show typical leading indicators of regime shifts. We then illustrate the impact of these general arguments by numerically examining the dynamics of several model ecological systems under slowly changing conditions. Our results offer a cautionary note about the generality of forecasting sudden changes in ecosystems.},

abstract = {1.Conservation of threatened species relies on predictions about their spatial distribution; however, it is often difficult to detect species in the wild. The combination of acoustic monitoring to improve species detectability and statistical methods to account for false negative detections can improve species distribution estimates. 2.Here, we combine a novel automated species-specific identification approach with occupancy models that account for imperfect detectability to provide a more accurate species distribution map of the Elfin-woods warbler Setophaga angelae, a rare, elusive, and threatened bird species. We also compared three automated species identification/validation approaches to determine which approach provided occupancy estimates similar to manual validation of all recordings. Acoustic data were collected along three elevational gradients (95 to 1074 m a.s.l) in El Yunque National Forest, Puerto Rico. The detection matrices acquired through automated species-specific identification models and manual validations of all recordings were used to create occupancy models. 3.Although this species has a wider distribution than previously reported, it depends on Palo Colorado forest cover and it mainly occurs between 600 and 900 m a.s.l. Unbiased and precise occupancy models were developed by using automated species identification models and only manually validating 4{\%} of the recordings. 4.Our approach draws on the strength of two active areas of ecological research: acoustic monitoring and occupancy modeling. Our methods provide an effective and efficient way to translate the enormous amount of acoustic information collected with passive acoustic monitoring devices into meaningful ecological data that can be applied to understand and map the distribution of rare, elusive and threatened species.

We have monitored the size, distribution, reproductive rate, and substrate use of the resulting breeding population (1979–2007). The population proceeded through an establishment phase (1979–1985) driven by releases with an average population doubling time of 1.3 yr to a consolidation phase (1986–2007) with an average doubling time of 23.4 yr. The region supported 55 breeding pairs by 2007.

abstract = {As well as there being a direct physical effect of the state (for example fat reserves, or size) of an animal on the risk of being caught by a predator, state also has an effect on predation risk indirectly through changes in behaviour. We present a mathematical model which looks at these two components of the effect of state on predation risk. We focus on two different models, (i) where the animal must achieve a fixed state and its fitness depends on the time at which this state is reached and (ii) where the animal must survive until a fixed time and its fitness depends on its final state. We investigate conditions under which the indirect effect of increased state is to increase or decrease predation risk, and give some numerical illustrations. Under certain conditions in the fixed-state model, the indirect effect of state is to increase predation risk, whereas under certain conditions in the fixed-time model the indirect effect of state is to decrease predation risk. We discuss the implications of our results for empirical investigations into the effect of state on predation risk.},

Social interactions give rise to complex 'interactive phenotypes' and group-level emergent properties. This type of phenotype has intriguing evolutionary implications, warranting a cohesive framework for its study. We detail here how a reaction-norm framework might be applied to usefully integrate social environment theory developed in behavioural ecology and quantitative genetics. The proposed emergent framework facilitates firm integration of social environments in adaptive research on phenotypic characters that vary within and among individuals.},

abstract = {This study describes annual variation in abundance and population status of non-breeding mi- gratory shorebirds in flooding pampa grasslands of Argentina. We studied two Nearctic species, the American Golden-Plover (Pluvialis dominica) and the Buff-breasted Sandpiper (Tryngites subruficollis), and two Patagonian species, the Tawny-throated Dotterel (Oreopholus ruficollis) and the Rufous-chested Dotterel (Charadrius modestus), at Medaland Ranch in the Villa Gesell District of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Counts were made every 15 d between March 1996 and January 2000. Numbers of Rufous-chested Dotterels were generally highest toward the end of winter (July–September) indicating that the species uses this area as a stopover site. Tawny-throatedDotterels were present throughout the entire winter period (April–September). The Nearctic species spent the austral spring– summer months at Medaland (September–February) before returning to their breeding grounds in North America. Comparison of our numbers to historic counts indicates declines of Buff-breasted Sandpipers (especially during the past 25 yr) and American Golden-Plovers throughout the past century. Medaland Ranch is clearly an important wintering site for these four migratory shorebirds. The departure of Patagonian species and the arrival of Nearctic species always occurred within a short period of time (days), but the time factor between departure of Nearctic and arrival of Patagonian species was measured in months. Our observations tend to support the hypothesis that the migratory pattern of Patagonian shorebirds results from avoiding competition with Nearctic shorebirds},

abstract = {1. The proposition that strong functional predator-prey links are associated wit compartments in food webs (Paine 1980) is examined for a large, well-documented web, the Ythan estuary. 2. A simple method for the detection and description of infrastructure within binary food webs is described and this is applied to 12 webs previously analysed by Pimm {\&} Lawton (1980) and to the Ythan web. 3. There was evidence for significant compartmentation in several real webs, all of which are reasonably well documented, aquatic and benthic. However, there was no evidence of compartments in the Ythan web. 4. Manipulative field experiments on a range of avian, fish and invertebrate predators provided no evidence for strong functional interactions in the Ythan web. 5. It is concluded that the lack of both compartments and strong linkage is consistent with Paine's hypothesis, but that the proposition needs further testing for other well-described systems.},

abstract = {Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) were followed throughout their annual cycle along the Pacific Coast of North America. Changes in body condition and corticosterone were tracked at two overwintering sites (Ensenada, Mexico, and San Diego, California), four migration stopover sites (Bodega Bay, California, Grays Harbor and False Bay, Washington, and Hartney Bay, Alaska), and a breeding site (Nome, Alaska). Adult males and females had elevated weight and fat scores during spring migration, breeding, and autumn migration relative to lean levels during winter. Although elevated mass and fat reserves may hinder escape from predators and are not necessary at wintering sites with benign conditions, the cost-benefit trade-offs with weight and agility shift during migration and breeding. Extra fat and muscle are necessary for fueling the long flight to and from the breeding grounds and serve as a hedge against unpredictable food and weather conditions on the breeding grounds. First-year birds weighed less and had lower fat reserves at smaller stopover sites than migrants at a large stopover site. Plasma levels of corticosterone revealed seasonal differences in the adrenocortical response to stress, although initial levels were fairly consistent across seasons. The highest stress response of the annual cycle in males was during autumn migration, in contrast to the lowest levels during early spring migration, breeding, and overwintering. Late-spring migrants and autumn premigrants had intermediate stress responses. An emerging pattern from this and other shorebird studies is that migrants with imminent flights of more than 1000 km have elevated corticosterone levels.},

abstract = {How individuals migrate over long distances is an enduring mystery of animal migration. Strong selection pressure for travelling in groups has been suggested in long-distance migrating species. Travelling in groups can reduce the energetic demands of long migration, increase navigational accuracy and favour group foraging at migratory halts. Nevertheless, this hypothesis has received scant attention. I examined evolutionary transitions in migration distance in all North American breeding species of birds. I documented 72 evolutionary shifts in migration distance in the pool of 409 species. In contrasting clades, long-distance migration, as opposed to short-distance migration, was associated with a larger travelling group size. No other transitions occurred alongside in other traits such as group size in the non-breeding season or body mass. The results suggest that larger group sizes have been beneficial in the evolution of long-distance migration in a large clade of birds.},

abstract = {Differential autumn migration of the Common Sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos) in the Duero valley (north-west Spain). This work shows information about the dynamics, differential migration and length of stop-over of the Common Sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos) during the autumn migration in the Duero valley (North-western, Spain). There were 150 specimens recovered out of 491 captured for ringing. Most of the adult birds (EURING Code 4 and 5, n = 206) passed between the second fortnight of July and the end of August, the passage of the younger ones (EURING Code 3, n = 162) falling mainly between the last week of July and the first fortnight of September. The maximum of adults captures ocurred 21 days before peak passage of the younger birds. Comparing the present result with those obtained in other study areas, we suggest that there is a delay in the advance of the younger birds compared with the adults in their movement to wintering areas. The mean stop-over length is similar between juveniles (3.44 days) and adults (3.91 days). The present study suggests an earlier migration for females compared with males. Finally, late migrants tend to stay longer.},

@article{brantModel2007,
abstract = {We used stochastic dynamic programming to investigate a spectacular migration strategy in the black brant Branta bernicla nigricans, a species of goose. Black brant migration is well suited for theoretical analysis since there are a number of existing strategies that easily can be compared. In early autumn, almost the entire population of the black brant gathers at Izembek Lagoon on the Alaska Peninsula to stage and refuel before the southward migration. There are at least three distinct strategies, with most geese making a spectacular direct migration more than 5000 km across the Gulf of Alaska to their wintering grounds in southern Baja California or mainland Mexico. This is a potentially dangerous strategy since foraging is not possible during the overseas passage. Some individuals instead use shorter flights to make a detour along the coast, a longer route that all individuals use for northwards migration in spring. Since flight costs accelerate with increasing body mass, migration by short flights is energetically cheaper than long-distance flights. A small but increasing part of the population has recently begun to winter at Izembek. We investigated this migration under two different suppositions using a dynamic state variable model. First, if the geese are free to make a strategic choice, under what assumptions should they prefer direct migration and under what assumptions should they prefer detour migration/winter residency? Second, provided that the dominating direct migration strategy is optimal, what conditions will force the geese to go for detour migration/winter residency? In the second case the geese may try to follow an optimal direct migration strategy, but stochastic events may force them to choose a suboptimal policy. We also simulated possible effects of global warming. The model suggests that the fuel level at arrival in Izembek and fuel gain rates are key factors and that tail winds must have been reliable in the past, otherwise direct migration could not have evolved. It also suggests that a change to milder winters may promote an unexpectedly abrupt change from long-distance to short-distance migration or winter residency. Finally, it produced a number of predictions that might be testable in the field. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Anti-predator vigilance describes how animals scan their environments for predators. For mathematical simplicity, theories of anti-predator vigilance have generally assumed that animlas initate scans with a constant probability for each unit of time spent feeding. Initiating scans in such a fashion would produce a wide distribution of intervals between scans. Because so much variation was assumed by theory, observations of variation have received little consideration. We show that the original theories of vigilance contain a conceptual discrepancy between the assumed predator and anti-predator tactics. Modified versions of the theory allow variation only under restrictive circumstances that seem unlikely to apply in nature. Plausible reasons for the observed variation in interscan interval are that theories of vigilance assume the wrong predator tactics or the wrong details of predator detection. These possibilities lead to testable predictions about how distributions of interscan intervals should change under different threat and detection conditions.},

abstract = {I consider how to classify and analyse models of the adaptive behaviour of an organism over a season. The classification is motivated by models of the timing of growth and reproduction in annual organisms, but applies to any model in which the population is unstructured at some convenient annual census time. During the season an organism makes a sequence of discrete behavioural choices. Each choice can be based on time in the season, any aspects of the organism's state, such as its size or energy reserves, and current environmental conditions. The organism may be subject to sources of demographic stochasticity that act independently on different population members. There may also be a source of environmental stochasticity, such as weather conditions that cause the environment as a whole to fluctuate. The classification of models given here is based on the types of stochasticity that act. I identify those models where the optimal strategy can be found simply by employing a dynamic optimization technique such as dynamic programming. For problems that are not solvable in this way, I outline other approaches that can be used to find a solution.},

abstract = {Summary Estimating the length-of-stay, the number of days a bird can be expected to stay at a site, at stopover sites is critical to understanding the migration ecology and estimating the population sizes of birds as they move between breeding and non-breeding sites. Estimating the length-of-stay of migrating animals at stopover sites has an analogue in the hydrological concept of transit time, the amount of time that water spends in a reservoir, which can be calculated as a numerical integration of inflow and outflow rates with an underlying Storage Age Selection function. We used this approach to estimate the lengths-of-stay of migrating Western Sandpiper (Calidris mauri) and Dunlin (Calidris alpina) based on the time series of daily counts at two sites in British Columbia, Canada. The approach yielded mean transit times for Western Sandpiper during southward migration at Sidney Island that ranged between 9·6 days and 3·8 days, and showed a significant decline over time, 1992–2001, and is consistent with the estimates obtained from the capture-mark-resight studies. Transit times during northward migration at Roberts Bank, Fraser River Delta, based on the best available information ranged from 1·8 to 3·2 days for Western Sandpiper, and had a median value of 2·0 days for Dunlin, which is consistent with the estimates obtained from the radio-telemetry studies. These results indicate that the hydrological flow models may offer a means to estimate the length-of-stay from the daily counts of birds during migration. The models present an opportunity for testing the alternate hypotheses concerning the roles of behavioural- vs. habitat-related mechanisms driving shorebird population sizes.},

@article{Goss-custard1991,
abstract = {(1) A winter survey of seven species of wading birds (Charadrii) at forty intertidal sites in six estuaries in south-west England was made to identify the variables that determined the variation in bird densities between the sites and to develop a method for predicting bird densities should a tidal power barrage be built on the Severn estuary. (2) The densities of the two smallest waders, the dunlin (Calidris alpina) and redshank (Tringa totanus), were comparable on the twelve sites in the Severn to those in the other estuaries. In contrast, the densities of the larger species, the grey plover (Pluvialis squatarola), bar-tailed and black-tailed godwits (Limosa lapponica and L. limosa), curlew (Numenius arquata) and oystercatcher post-barrage values could themselves be predicted. Although the densities of six of the ten most important prey categories correlated with static environmental variables, such as the particle-size and organic content of the sediment, the fact that a site was in the Severn had a significant additional effect on invertebrate density in seven cases. This suggests that there is a special feature of the Severn, probably one associated with its highly dynamic nature, whose effect was not captured by measuring static variables. This factor must be identified, and the effect of a barrage upon it evaluated, if the post-barrage densities of invertebrates, and thus of the birds, are to be successfully predicted. (Haematopus ostragleus), were comparatively low on sites in the Severn. (3) Within most estuaries, bird densities correlated with the densities of one to three widely taken prey species. When data from all estuaries were combined, bird densities correlated with the densities of one or two prey species, the polychaete worm Nereis diversicolor providing the best correlation in five cases. The densities of the larger birds were correlated with the densities of their larger-sized prey. Allowing for the effects of prey density, sediment parameters correlated additionally with the density of bar-tailed godwit and redshank and exposure-time correlated with the density of oystercatcher. (4) When the effects of these variables were taken into account, bird densities on sites on the Severn were only significantly different from those on other estuaries for one or two species. Therefore, the low densities of larger wader species on the Severn can be explained by the low densities there of the larger-sized polychaete worms and bivalve molluscs upon which they feed: there was no reason to invoke a special unidentified factor in the Severn to account for the low densities of these species. It was concluded that other estuaries provide an analogue with which to predict post-barrage bird densities on the Severn from predicted densities of their prey. (5) By holding back the ebbing tide, a barrage would substantially reduce the area of intertidal flats available at low water for the birds to feed. On the other hand, the productivity of the estuary, and thus the invertebrate density, could increase in the generally more benign post-barrage environmental conditions. Wader densities would have to increase approximately twofold to allow the same overall numbers of birds to remain post-barrage as occur on the Severn at present. Provisional estimates are given of the increases in prey density required to allow bird densities to increase by this amount. With the -exception of the prey of dunlin, the required values fall well within the ranges of densities found in other estuaries, and so could in principle be attained in the post-barrage Severn. (6) An attempt was made to derive equations with which to predict post-barrage densities of invertebrates from easily measured, static environmental variables whose},

abstract = {At temperate latitudes densities and biomass of intertidal molluscs tend to be strongly seasonal. Here we provide a comparative study on seasonality of bivalves and gastropods in the tropical intertidal seagrass-covered soft sediment environment of Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania (20°N, 16°W). In this system, benthivorous shorebirds exert considerable predation pressure with strong seasonal variations. It has been proposed that during the period when (adult) shorebirds are absent (May-August) benthic biomass would be able to recover, but a first test was inconclusive. Over a full year (March 2011-February 2012), each month we sampled benthic invertebrates at sixteen permanent sites. The total of 3763 specimens comprised 20 species, representing eight orders and 19 families. Bivalves were much more common than gastropods. The bivalve Loripes lucinalis dominated the assemblage throughout the year (58{\%} of total number), followed by Dosinia isocardia (10{\%}), Senilia senilis (8{\%}) and the gastropod Gibbula umbilicalis (6{\%}). Average biomass amounted to 32 g AFDM/m2, of which the large West-African bloody cockle Senilia made up three-quarter, Loripes 16{\%}, Gibbula 2{\%} and Dosinia 1{\%}. Across the 20 species, lowest densities were reached in late spring (May) and summer (Aug.), whereas highest densities occurred in autumn (Oct.). The lowest overall density of 676 specimens/m2 in August more than doubled to a peak density of 1538 specimens/m2 in October, most of the increase being due to strong recruitment in both Loripes (densities increasing from 322 specimens/m2 in Sept. to 785 specimens/m2 in Oct.) and Dosinia (densities increasing from 18 specimens/m2 in Aug. to 265 specimens/m2 in Sept.). Our results suggest that by the time the feathered molluscivore predators returned in high numbers to Banc d'Arguin (after their summer breeding season in the Arctic), benthic animals were at a peak. In order to quantitatively understand the seasonal changes in mollusc abundance, we build upon a recently published optimal diet model in which the most abundant molluscivore shorebird, the red knot (Calidris canutus), could choose between Loripes and Dosinia. Observed changes in densities of these two bivalves closely match depletion trajectories predicted by the model. We conclude that molluscivore shorebirds are able to deplete their food stocks in the course of their 'winter' in a tropical intertidal area. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

The uncertainty analysis indicates a 95{\%} confidence interval in NH spring SCE of ±5–10{\%} over the pre-satellite period and ±3–5{\%} over the satellite era. The multi-dataset analysis shows larger uncertainties monitoring spring SCE over Eurasia (EUR) than North America (NA) due to the more complex regional character of the snow cover variability and larger between-dataset variability over northern Europe and north-central Russia.$\backslash$n Trend analysis of the updated SCE series provides evidence that NH spring snow cover extent has undergone significant reductions over the past {\~{}}90 yr and that the rate of decrease has accelerated over the past 40 yr. The rate of decrease in March and April NH SCE over the 1970–2010 period is {\~{}}0.8 million km2 per decade corresponding to a 7{\%} and 11{\%} decrease in NH March and April SCE respectively from pre-1970 values. In March, most of the change is being driven by Eurasia (NA trends are not significant) but both continents exhibit significant SCE reductions in April.$\backslash$n The observed trends in SCE are being mainly driven by warmer air temperatures, with NH mid-latitude air temperatures explaining {\~{}}50{\%} of the variance in NH spring snow cover over the 89-yr period analyzed. However, there is also evidence that changes in atmospheric circulation around 1980 involving the North Atlantic Oscillation and Scandinavian pattern have contributed to reductions in March SCE over Eurasia.},

abstract = {1. Rate-maximizing foragers that only divide their time between searching and handling prey should, according to the classical contingency model (CM), only select those prey whose energy content per unit handling time (i.e. profitability) exceeds or equals long-term average energy intake rate. 2. However, if digestively constrained foragers were to follow this so-called 'zero-one rule', they would need to take digestive breaks and their energy intake over total time would not be maximized. They should, according to the digestive rate model (DRM), also consider the rate at which a prey type is digested (i.e. digestive quality), such that time lost to digestive breaks is minimized. 3. In three different contexts, we tested these competing models in a mollusc-eating shorebird, the red knot (Calidris canutus), that is often digestively constrained due to its habit of ingesting its bulky prey whole. Measurements on gizzard size (using ultrasonography) and prey-characteristics confirmed that in each test the birds were digestively bottlenecked and should thus follow the DRM in order to maximize long-term energy intake. 4. In the first experiment, knots were offered a choice between two fully exposed prey, and tended to select prey by the criterion of digestive quality rather than profitability. 5. In the second experiment, knots were offered two buried prey types and preferred the highest quality prey to the most profitable prey. 6. In the wild, knots mainly fed on high quality Mya and largely ignored poor quality, but equally profitable, Cerastoderma. 7. Thus, each test verified the predictions of the DRM and rejected those of the CM. Given that many species face digestion constraints, we expect that the DRM is likely to explain diet composition in many more studies.},

abstract = {Several migratory bird species show active cycles of hypertrophy and atrophy of nutritional organs and selected muscle groups. We develop a model for nutritional organs to identify the conditions under which such a pattern of structural change is optimal. Migrants may choose the size of two components of lean mass: a constant component that they carry throughout the entire migration period and a component just deposited during stopover. The benefit of depositing and subsequently discarding additional tissues in nutritional organs during stopover is an increased fuelling rate and a decrease in flight costs; the cost of hypertrophy and atrophy is a time cost. The predicted pattern depends strongly on the lean mass with which the migrants enter the migratory period. Time-selected migrants flying between widely separated stopover sites should show the highest degree of structural plasticity if they commence migration with a lean mass below maximum. If stopovers are possible everywhere along the migratory route, cycles of hypertrophy and atrophy are still possible but less likely. We also discuss the consequence of using different currencies in the optimization procedure. Only if duration of migration is a component of fitness can structural changes be expected. If the energy cost of transport is minimized, there is no unique prediction about active changes in lean mass. For short migration distances, it may be optimal to burn the lean mass deposited at the start of the stopover as fuel instead of discarding it before departure.},

abstract = {One of the main hypotheses formulated to explain why marsh birds, wildfowl, and shorebirds forage at night postulates that the birds prefer to feed at night because the feeding opportunities are most profitable then. To investigate this hypothesis, we compare day- and night-time availability and describe the diel abundance rhythm of swimming and benthic organisms inhabiting the shallow waters of a tropical lagoon complex in northeastern Venezuela. Three sampling techniques were used by day and by night: net sampling for swimming organisms, core sampling for those in the sediments (10 cm deep), and sight counts for organisms on the surface of substrata. Overall, in the case of swimming organisms, fishes, isopods, amphipods, shrimps (Penaeus spp.), and corixids were 3-30 times more abundant at night than during daytime. In general, infaunal organisms were about equally abundant during the day and the night, or slightly more abundant during the day. At the surface, isopods, amphipods, and polychaetes were greater than 10 times more abundant at night than during the day. However, gastropods were slightly more numerous during daytime on the substrata, while pelecypods were about equally numerous during day- and night-time. Fiddler crabs (Uca sp.) were generally more available during daytime. Considering all organisms together, the prey for marsh birds, wildfowl, and shorebirds were significantly more abundant at night. In conclusion, tactile-foraging species (e.g., spoonbills, skimmers, ibises, dabbling ducks, and several species of shorebirds) should profit by foraging only at night and resting during the day, and foraging during daylight only to top up a nighttime deficit. On the other hand, despite limited nighttime visual capacity, some sight-feeding species (e.g., herons, plovers) may take advantage of increased prey availability at night, at least on moonlit nights.},

abstract = {Understanding the influence of parasites on the community ecology of free-living organisms is an emerging theme in ecology. The cockle Austrovenus stutchburyi is an abundant mollusc inhabiting the sheltered shores of New Zealand. This species, which lives just a few centimetres under the surface, plays a key role for many benthic invertebrate species, because in these habitats the cockle shell is the only available hard surface where invertebrates can establish. However, the behaviour of this cockle can be altered locally by a parasite, the trematode Curtuteria australis. Indeed, heavily infected cockles are unable to bury perfectly and typically lie entirely exposed at the surface of the mud. In this study we investigated the ecological consequences of this behavioural alteration for two invertebrate species commonly associated with cockles, the anemone Anthopleura aureoradiata and the limpet Notoacmea helmsi. A field study first demonstrated that in both infected and non-infected populations of cockles, there was a negative relationship between the number of anemones and limpets found on cockles. In the laboratory, we showed that predation of limpets by anemones is possible when they share the same cockle shell. In a heavily infected population of cockles, limpets were significantly more frequent and more abundant on cockles manipulated by C. australis than on cockles with a normal behaviour. A colonization test conducted in natural conditions demonstrated that the predominance of limpets on manipulated cockles results from a direct habitat preference. Conversely anemones were significantly less frequent and less abundant on manipulated cockles than on cockles manipulated by C. australis. A desiccation test revealed that, relative to limpets, they had a lower resistance to this physical stress. We discuss our results in relation to current ideas on ecosystem engineering by organisms.},

abstract = {The burrowing crab Chasmagnathus granulatus is an important bioturbator that generates dense burrow assemblages (crab beds) characteristic of intertidal habitats of SW Atlantic estuaries. Crab bioturbation affects the topography and hydrodynamics of the sediment, increasing sediment water and organic matter content, decreasing sediment hardness and changing the grain size frequency distribution. In this study, we found that burrowing crabs can decrease the impact of predation by shorebirds on polychaetes. The polychaete Laeonereis acuta Treadwell has U-shaped burrows outside crab beds, which are associated with surface deposit-feeding while their burrows are mainly I-shaped inside which is associated with subsurface deposit feeding behavior. This pattern is likely the result of larger vertical sediment mixing inside crab beds due to crab burrowing. As a result of their feeding strategy, polychaetes appear on the surface more often outside crab beds, which increases their availability for shorebirds. In addition, shorebird species differentially use crab beds. The White-rumped Sandpiper, Calidris fuscicollis Vieillot, preferentially forage outside crab beds, meanwhile the Two-banded Plover Charadrius falklandicus Latham forage more frequently inside crab beds. However, experiments excluding shorebirds inside and outside crab beds showed negative effects of shorebirds only outside crab beds. Thus, our results show that the SW Atlantic burrowing crab C. granulatus affects the strength of the predator-prey interaction between shorebirds and polychaetes.

abstract = {We report that a latitudinal cline in intertidal food distribution is associated with the nonbreeding distribution of the Western Sandpiper ( Calidris mauri). This novel result is the first to demonstrate a clear relationship between patterns of differential nonbreeding distribution and food availability for any shorebird species. Within each age class and sex, longer- billed Western Sandpipers winter further south. Moreover, females, the longer- billed sex, tend to winter south of males. Thus, both inter- and intra- sexual clines in bill morphology result in an overall gradient of increasing bill length from north to south. Longer- billed birds are able to extract prey that are buried more deeply in the sediment; therefore, we predicted shifts in the vertical distribution of food resources to coincide with the clines in bill morphology across the nonbreeding range. We tested our prediction by measuring bio. lm density and the vertical distribution of macrofaunal invertebrates at six nonbreeding sites. Although no latitudinal trend was observed for bio. lm, the vertical distribution of invertebrates was consistent with our prediction and revealed that the greatest relative abundance of surface prey occurred at northern nonbreeding sites and declined with decreasing latitude. We discuss the potential implications of these. ndings in the context of competing evolutionary hypotheses of differential migration and bill dimorphism in shorebirds.},

abstract = {Little is known about the effect of commercial rockweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) harvest on intertidal community structure, and on interactions among species. Using predator-exclusion cages and by simulating rockweed harvest, we studied the combined effects of predation by common eiders (Somateria mollissima) and harvest on an intertidal invertebrate community associated with rockweed. Predation had no effect on invertebrate species richness, and only a short-term ({\textless} 1 year) negative effect on total invertebrate biomass. Most of this was due to a decline in common periwinkle abundance in controls relative to exclosures. Eiders had no clear effect on blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), their preferred prey, probably because predation by dogwhelks (Nucella lapillus), which were likely the more important predator in this system, more than compensated for the absence of duck predation. Rockweed harvest had no overall effect on the invertebrate community, but did reduce the effectiveness of ducks as predators during summer, when ducklings and associated females fed on invertebrates at the top of the rockweed canopy. We conclude, by comparing results with a similar experiment conducted in the adjacent mussel bed, that both ducks and whelks are major predators of blue mussels, but that their relative importance differs in the two areas, probably as a result of differences in habitat dimensionality and heterogeneity.},

abstract = {Many populations of wader species have shown a strong decline in number in Western-Europe in recent years. The use of simple population models such as matrix models can contribute to conserve these populations by identifying the most profitable management measures. Parameterization of such models is often hampered by the availability of demographic data (survival and reproduction). In particular, data on survival in the pre-adult (immature) stage of wader species that remain in wintering areas outside Europe are notoriously difficult to obtain, and are therefore virtually absent in the literature. To diagnose population decline in the wader species; Black-tailed Godwit, Curlew, Lapwing, Oystercatcher, and Redshank, we extended an existing modelling framework in which incomplete demographic data can be analysed, developed for species with a pre-adult stage of one year. The framework is based on a Leslie matrix model with three parameters: yearly reproduction (number of fledglings per pair), yearly pre-adult (immature) and yearly adult (mature) survival. The yearly population growth rate of these populations and the relative sensitivity of this rate to changes in survival and reproduction parameters (the elasticity) were calculated numerically and, if possible, analytically. The results showed a decrease in dependence on reproduction and an increase in pre-adult survival of the population growth rate with an increase in the duration of the pre-adult stage. In general, adult survival had the highest elasticity, but elasticity of pre-adult survival increased with time to first reproduction, a result not reported earlier. Model results showed that adult survival and reproduction estimates reported for populations of Redshank and Curlew were too low to maintain viable populations. Based on the elasticity patterns and the scope for increase in actual demographic parameters we inferred that conservation of the Redshank and both Curlew populations should focus on reproduction. For one Oystercatcher and the Black-tailed Godwit populations we suggested a focus on both reproduction and pre-adult survival. For the second Oystercatcher population pre-adult survival seemed the most promising target for conservation. And for the Lapwing populations all demographic parameters should be considered.

abstract = {Urbanization and domestication share features in terms of characters that are favored by selection. These include loss of fear of humans, reduced corticosterone levels, prolonged breeding seasons, and several others. Here, I test the hypothesis that urban- ization results from differential colonization of urban areas by species with heterogeneous levels of fear in the ancestral rural populations, followed by a reduction in variance in fear responses with a subsequent increase in diversity of fear responses as urban populations become adapted to the urban environment. Using information on variance in flight initiation distances (FIDs) when approached by a human, I show that rural populations of birds characterized by short mean flight distances and large variances in flight distances differentially colonized urban areas. As a consequence of this urban invasion, urban popula- tions lost variation in FID. The variance in FID was initially larger in rural than in urban populations but eventually became larger in urban populations with time since urbanization. This secondary increase in variance in FID of urban populations was associated with an increase in population density of urban populations, suggesting that as birds became adapted to urban areas, they secondarily gained variance in behavioral flexibility.

abstract = {Decisions taken during migration can have a large effect on the fitness of birds. Migration must be accurately timed with food availability to allow efficient fueling but is also constrained by the optimal arrival date at the breeding site. The decision of when to leave a site can be driven by energetics (sufficient body stores to fuel flight), time-related cues (internal clock under photoperiodic control), or external cues (temperature, food resources). An individual based model (IBM) that allows a mechanistic description of a range of departure decision rules was applied to the spring migration of pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) from wintering grounds in Denmark to breeding grounds on Svalbard via 2 Norwegian staging sites. By comparing predicted with observed departure dates, we tested 7 decision rules. The most accurate predictions were obtained from a decision rule based on a combination of cues including the amount of body stores, date, and plant phenology. Decision rules changed over the course of migration with the external cue decreasing in importance and the time-related cue increasing in importance for sites closer to breeding grounds. These results are in accordance with descriptions of goose migration, following the “green-wave”: Geese track the onset of plant growth as it moves northward in spring, with an uncoupling toward the end of the migration if time is running out. We demonstrate the potential of IBMs to study the possible mechanisms underlying stopover ecology in migratory birds and to serve as tools to predict consequences of environmental change.},

Long-billed Dowitchers, and Stilt, Semipalmated, and Least Sandpipers spent most of their time feeding in spring and fall. American Avocets also used prairie potholes for feeding, but other activities like locomotion, body maintenance, and sleep consumed large proportions of time. Time spent in various behaviors was similar among three diurnal (early, midday, and late) time periods during spring and fall. Avocets and dowitchers slept more during midday than early or late periods. Flock size was smaller during spring than fall in both years for American Avocets, Long-billed Dowitchers, Semipalmated Sandpipers, and Least Sandpipers and in 1994 for Stilt Sandpipers. More than half of all aggressive encounters by American Avocets, Stilt Sandpipers, Semipalmated Sandpipers, and Least Sandpipers were intraspecific during feeding. Smaller flock sizes in spring may be related to avoidance of costly aggression in spring and/or the numbers of birds migrating through the region. The Prairie Pothole Region serves as a stopover for most shorebirds to acquire energy reserves during migration, and conservation efforts should focus on preserving and enhancing prairie potholes for foraging shorebirds.},

We report here the application of an evolutionary stable strategy model to a three-morph mating system in the side-blotched lizard. Using parameter estimates from field data, the model predicted oscillations in morph frequency, and the frequencies of the three male morphs were found to oscillate over a six-year period in the field. The fitnesses of each morph relative to other morphs were non-transitive in that each morph could invade another morph when rare, but was itself invadable by another morph when common. Concordance between frequency-dependent selection and the among-year changes in morph fitnesses suggest that male interactions drive a dynamic 'rock–paper–scissors' game7.},

abstract = {Migration distance is supposed to represent an impor- tant selection pressure shaping physiological and morphological properties. Previous work has focussed on this effect, while the importance of ecological barriers in this context has been rarely considered.We studied two subspecies of a migratory songbird, the northern wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe oenanthe and O. o. leucorhoa L.), on an island in the North Sea. The former subspecies reaches their Scandinavian breeding areas after a short sea crossing, whereas leucorhoa northern wheatears cross the North Atlantic towards Iceland, Greenland or Canada. Physiological traits (fuel deposition rate) andwings' aerodynam- ic properties (wing pointedness independent of body size), both affecting migration speed, were hypothesized to be more pro- nounced in leucorhoa than in oenanthe northern wheatears. Within subspecies, the physiological and aerodynamic properties were hypothesized to explain arrival date at the stopover sitewith “fast migrants” arriving early. Physiological and aerodynamic properties in leucorhoa northern wheatears lead to a faster and less costly migration, favouring a sea crossing, but in trade-off lower flight manoeuvrability than in oenanthe birds. Wings' aerodynamic properties affected the seasonal occurrence of leucorhoa females, whereas the physiological traits significantly influenced arrival date in oenanthe individuals. The less risky migration route in oenanthe birds with few short sea crossings may have favoured higher flight manoeuvrability for foraging (less pointed wings), in trade-off an energetically more costly flight. Hence, not the migration distance itself, but the presence/ absence of a sea barrier presents an important selection pressure in migratory land birds favouring low flight costs},

abstract = {We studied the migratory movements of radio-equipped Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) along a 4,000 km stretch of the west coast of North America from California to Alaska during the 1992 spring migration. A total of 77 shorebirds were radio-tagged at San Francisco Bay, CA; Bolinas Lagoon, CA; Fraser River Delta, British Columbia; and the Stikine River Delta, AK. Daily aerial and ground monitoring from mid-April to late May at banding sites as well as the Copper River Delta provided data on length of stay of individual shorebirds and migration times between study areas. Fifty-eight shorebirds were detected beyond banding sites for a 74{\%} net relocation rate. The proportion of birds detected along the migration route increased with latitude: Grays Harbor, WA (3.4{\%}); Fraser River, British Columbia (8.6{\%}); Stikine River, AK (28.6{\%}); and Copper River, AK (62.3{\%}). Length of stay averaged three days per site. We failed to detect differences in length of stay among sites or between sexes. A condition index calculated as body mass standardized for body size was a poor indicator of length of stay at a site or migration time among sites. An estimated 26{\%} of radio-equipped birds were never relocated suggesting that migrant birds use smaller dispersed wetlands as well as the major intertidal wetland complexes we studied. We conclude that most spring migrant Western Sandpipers use a short-flight hopping migration strategy rather than a few sustained long flights. The short-flight strategy emphasizes the importance of maintaining a continuous complex of intertidal wetland habitats along the migration route to ensure shorebird conservation.},

abstract = {Recent advances in spring arrival dates have been reported in many migratory species but the mechanism driving these advances is unknown. As population declines are most widely reported in species that are not advancing migration, there is an urgent need to identify the mechanisms facilitating and constraining these advances. Individual plasticity in timing of migration in response to changing climatic conditions is commonly proposed to drive these advances but plasticity in individual migratory timings is rarely observed. For a shorebird population that has significantly advanced migration in recent decades, we show that individual arrival dates are highly consistent between years, but that the arrival dates of new recruits to the population are significantly earlier now than in previous years. Several mechanisms could drive advances in recruit arrival, none of which require individual plasticity or rapid evolution of migration timings. In particular, advances in nest-laying dates could result in advanced recruit arrival, if benefits of early hatching facilitate early subsequent spring migration. This mechanism could also explain why arrival dates of short-distance migrants, which generally return to breeding sites earlier and have greater scope for advance laying, are advancing more rapidly than long-distance migrants.},

abstract = {The discovery that some shorebird species graze heavily on biofilm adds importance to elucidating coastal processes controlling biofilm, as well as impetus to better understand patterns of shorebird use of intertidal flats. Western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) and dunlin (Calidris alpina) stopover in the hundreds of thousands on the Fraser River estuary, British Columbia, Canada, during northward migration to breeding areas. Western sandpipers show greater modification of tongue and bill morphology for biofilm feeding than dunlin, and their diet includes more biofilm. Therefore, we hypothesized that these congeners differentially use the intertidal area. A tide following index (TFI) was used to describe their distributions in the upper intertidal during ebbing tides. Also, we assessed sediment grain size, biofilm (= microphytobenthic or MPB) biomass and invertebrate abundance. Foraging dunlin closely followed the ebbing tide line, exploiting the upper intertidal only as the tide retreated through this area. In contrast, western sandpipers were less prone to follow the tide, and spent more time in the upper intertidal. Microphytobenthic biomass and sediment water content were highest in the upper intertidal, indicating greater biofilm availability for shorebirds in the first 350m from shore. Invertebrate density did not differ between sections of the upper intertidal. Overall, western sandpiper behaviour and distribution more closely matched MPB biofilm availability than invertebrate availability. Conservation of sandpipers should consider physical processes, such as tides and currents, which maintain the availability of biofilm, a critical food source during global migration.},

abstract = {I examined the foraging behaviour of American and Magellanic oystercatchers on Patagonian tidal flats in the context of several abiotic and social factors. I analyzed the simultaneous effect of tidal state, wind speed, temperature, habitat preference, and species abundance of one species on the other by means of multiway contingency tables and loglinear models. Diets of both species were similar and reflected the natural abundances of prey items in the tidal flats. Both species were strongly influenced by tidal state when selecting foraging habitat, but other factors modified their preferences. I found that the foraging behavior of American Oystercatchers was determined solely by abiotic factors; i.e., tidal state, foraging period, and a higher order interaction effect between wind speed and tidal state. By contrast, no combination of abiotic factors was sufficient to explain the observed abundances of Magellanic Oystercatchers. Instead, their foraging behavior was facilitated by the presence of congeners in addition to abiotic factors.},

abstract = {Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) have become conspicuous members of the bird assemblage at Tatoosh Island, Washington, since 1983. We have sufficient before and after observations and data to conclude that two species of storm-petrel (Oceanodroma spp.) show no significant population trends (as based on catch per hour in standardized mist nets from 1978-1988) and that numbers of both Cassin's (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and Rhinoceros (Cerorhinca monocerata) auklets, the primary falcon prey, are probably declining. An important effect of falcons is their consumption of Northwestern Crows (Corvus caurinus) or simply restriction of crow activities. The numbers of Common Murres (Uria aalge) and Pelagic Cor- morants (Phalacrocorax pelagicus) that inhabit Tatoosh have increased markedly, probably due to significantly decreased crow-related egg predation. The fledging rate of Black Oystercatch- ers (Haematopus bachmani) approximately doubled in 1987, when one falcon routinely ate crows. These relationships appear to be independent of the locally abundant Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens). We conclude that the indirect, positive effects are at least as important to seabird abundance patterns as are direct, negative effects. We suggest that more attention be paid to corvid activities near seabird colonies and, especially, that the impact on populations of small alcids or other prey be considered when planning conservation efforts to augment the population of an effective avian predator.

abstract = {We present a case study of the rose hip fly, Rhagoletis basiola, to demonstrate how one can connect landscape to population and evolutionary dynamics through the responses of individuals. Survey data from six different isolated rose habitats (Rosa sp.) near Vancouver, Canada were analyzed to determine the spatial distribution of rose hips within and among bushes. Rose hips were clumped at all sites; there was statistically significant variation in degree of clumping among sites. However, analyses using dynamic life history theory suggest that much of this variation may be mitigated by oviposition and movement response of individual flies to fruit distribution: sites that differ structurally may not differ evolutionarily. With this in mind, we provide five different indices that could be used to evaluate fly performance on different landscapes: 1) the probability that a cell r units away contains resource, given that the current cell contains resource, 2) the probability that a cell r units away contains resource, given that the current cell is devoid of resource, 3) the optimal distance to move from a cell that harbors fruit, 4) the optimal distance to move from a cell that is devoid of fruit, and 5) the Expected Reproductive Success of a fly in a particular habitat. Those indices provide the link between landscape and individual behavior and suggest another way of addressing habitat conservation issues.},

abstract = {When birds are attacked by predators, take-off ability is crucial for the chance of survival. Recently, theoretical studies have predicted that predation risk in terms of reduced flight performance increases with body mass. However, empirical data are scarce. Because migratory birds sometimes double their body mass, mass dependent predation risk may be especially important during migratory fattening. Here we present the first study of take-off ability in relation to migratory fat load. Alarmed take-off flights of caged blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) induced by a simulated predator attack were analysed in terms of velocity and angle of ascent. Fat loads (percentage of fat-free body mass) of the birds ranged from 1{\%} to 59{\%}. An increase in fat load was found to influence both velocity and angle of ascent. From our results we calculated that blackcaps carrying 60{\%} fat loads would have 32{\%} lower angle of ascent and 17{\%} lower velocity than blackcaps carrying no fat load. Even though the effect of fat load on the blackcaps was less than indicated in previous experimental studies of other species, our results suggest that the large fat loads needed for migration probably place them at increased risk of predation.},

abstract = {Potential prey are often exposed to multiple predators that vary in their foraging tactics and ability to detect prey. For animals that rely on crypsis to avoid predators, one solution is to alter their behaviour or appearance to maximize crypsis in ways that are specific to different types of predator. We tested whether dwarf chameleons ( Bradypodion transvaalense ) showed different behavioural responses, including colour change, towards multiple predators (bird and snake models) that detect and capture prey in different ways, and whether these antipredator responses varied geographically. Chameleons consistently used the same body postures (lateral compression and flipping to the oppo- site side of the branch) and displayed similar chromatic (colour) contrast against the natural background in response to both predator types. However, they became significantly more achromatically contrasting (brighter) in the pres- ence of the snake compared to the bird. This relative difference in achromatic contrast towards the two types of pred- ator was consistent among populations. There were also significant differences in both absolute achromatic and chromatic contrast among populations despite very similar light environment, background coloration and habitat structure. Our results highlight facultative crypsis as one type of flexible antipredator tactic and emphasize the importance of visual ecology in understanding prey–predator interactions},

abstract = {Why females assess ornaments when choosing mates remains a central question in evolutionary biology. We hypothesize that the imperative for a choosing female to find a mate with nuclear oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes that are compatible with her mitochondrial OXPHOS genes drives the evolution of ornaments. Indicator traits are proposed to signal the efficiency of OXPHOS function thus enabling females to select mates with nuclear genes that are compatible with maternal mitochondrial genes in the formation of OXPHOS complexes. Species-typical pattern of ornamentation is proposed to serve as a marker of mitochondrial type ensuring that females assess prospective mates with a shared mitochondrial background. The mitonuclear compatibility hypothesis predicts that the production of ornaments will be closely linked to OXPHOS pathways, and that sexual selection for compatible mates will be strongest when genes for nuclear components of OXPHOS complexes are Z-linked. The implications of this hypothesis are that sexual selection may serve as a driver for the evolution of more efficient cellular respiration.},

abstract = {A growing number of studies have documented shifts in avian migratory phenology in response to climate change, and yet there is a large amount of unexplained variation in the magnitude of those responses across species and geographic regions. We use a database of citizen science bird observations to explore spatiotemporal variation in mean arrival dates across an unprecedented geographic extent for 18 common species in North America over the past decade, relating arrival dates to mean minimum spring temperature. Across all species and geographic locations, species shifted arrival dates 0.8 days earlier for every °C of warming of spring temperature, but it was common for some species in some locations to shift as much as 3-6 days earlier per °C. Species that advanced arrival dates the earliest in response to warming were those that migrate more slowly, short distance migrants, and species with broader climatic niches. These three variables explained 63{\%} of the interspecific variation in phenological response. We also identify a latitudinal gradient in the average strength of phenological response, with species shifting arrival earlier at southern latitudes than northern latitudes for the same degree of warming. This observation is consistent with the idea that species must be more phenologically sensitive in less seasonal environments to maintain the same degree of precision in phenological timing.},

abstract = {Predictive population modeling contributes to our basic scientific understanding of population dynamics, but can also inform management decisions by evaluating alternative actions in virtual environments. Quantitative models mathematically reflect scientific hypotheses about how a system functions. In Delaware Bay, mid-Atlantic Coast, USA, to more effectively manage horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) harvests and protect Red Knot (Calidris canutus rufa) populations, models are used to compare harvest actions and predict the impacts on crab and knot populations. Management has been chiefly driven by the core hypothesis that horseshoe crab egg abundance governs the survival and reproduction of migrating Red Knots that stopover in the Bay during spring migration. However, recently, hypotheses proposing that knot dynamics are governed by cyclical lemming dynamics garnered some support in data analyses. In this paper, I present alternative models of Red Knot population dynamics to reflect alternative hypotheses. Using 2 models with different lemming population cycle lengths and 2 models with different horseshoe crab effects, I project the knot population into the future under environmental stochasticity and parametric uncertainty with each model. I then compare each model's predictions to 10 yr of population monitoring from Delaware Bay. Using Bayes' theorem and model weight updating, models can accrue weight or support for one or another hypothesis of population dynamics. With 4 models of Red Knot population dynamics and only 10 yr of data, no hypothesis clearly predicted population count data better than another. The collapsed lemming cycle model performed best, accruing {\~{}}35{\%} of the model weight, followed closely by the horseshoe crab egg abundance model, which accrued {\~{}}30{\%} of the weight. The models that predicted no decline or stable populations (i.e. the 4-yr lemming cycle model and the weak horseshoe crab effect model) were the most weakly supported.},

Geospiza fortis x G. scandens F-1 hybrids backcrossed to both of the parental species, whereas all backcrosses bred with the parental species to which they were most related, or with hybrids. Paternal song was shown to be the crucial factor determining the mating pattern of G. fortis x G. scandens F-1 hybrids and their offspring. Song is culturally inherited, transmitted faithfully from father to son (with few exceptions) as a result of an imprinting-like process. Size also contributes to the choice of mates. G. fortis x G. scandens F-1 hybrid females paired with large G. scandens-like G. fortis males. G. fortis x C. fuliginosa F-1 hybrids paired negatively assortatively with respect to the size of their G. fortis mates. Non-random mating of hybrids based on song, a non-genetic trait, has interesting evolutionary consequences. Sang characteristics and nuclear and mitochondrial genes flow from G. fuliginosa into the G. fortis population, whereas the direction of transfer of genetic and song information between G. fortis and G. scandens depends on which song was sung by the father of the hybrids.

We tested whether freezing behaviour (complete immobility in a previously foraging bird) observed in chaffinches before escaping from an approaching potential threat functions as a period of risk-assessment, and whether information on predator identity is gained even when time available is very short. We flew either a model of a sparrowhawk (predator) or a woodpigeon (no threat) at single chaffinches. Escape delays were significantly shorter with the hawk, except when a model first appeared close to the chaffinch. Chaffinches were significantly more vigilant when they resumed feeding after exposure to the sparrowhawk compared to the woodpigeon showing that they were able to distinguish between threats, and this applied even when time available for assessment was short (an average of 0.29 s). Our results show freezing in chaffinches functions as an effective economic risk assessment period, and that threat information is gained even when very short periods of time are available during an attack.},

abstract = {Shorebirds migrating through the Southern Great Plains (SGP), USA, use freshwater playas and saline lakes as stopovers. The importance of playas is well documented, but the role of saline lakes is not clearly understood. During 2002 and 2003, we conducted surveys to determine the extent to which the saline lakes serve as stopovers. Twenty-eight species were recorded, and total seasonal abundance ranged from 6779 to 29,924 birds. Potential shorebird abundance for extant saline lakes was estimated at 37,000-71,000 shorebirds annually. American Avocets (Recurvirostra americana), Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri), Baird's Sandpipers (C bairdi), Least Sandpipers (C minutilla), Snowy Plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus), Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), and Wilson's Phalaropes (Phalaropus tricolor) were the most abundant species. Community composition of shorebirds differed between saline lakes and regional freshwater playas. Peak spring abundance was generally in April, whereas summer/fall migration was more protracted and shorebird abundance peaked during 6-8 weeks in August and September. Migration chronologies differed among morphologically similar species, and among representative species from different guilds. Such patterns of temporal separation permit partitioning of resources by shorebirds migrating through the SGP. The saline lakes of the SGP should be regarded as stopover sites of regional and international value. To ensure that saline lakes function as stopovers and to help maintain those unique communities that inhabit them, conservation of saline takes should focus on preserving spring flows and conserving water.},

abstract = {1. Information-theory procedures are powerful tools for multimodel inference and are now standard methods in ecology.When performingmodel averaging on a given set ofmodels, the importance of a predictor variable is commonly estimated by summing the weights ofmodelswhere the variable appears, the so-called sumof weights (SW). However, SWs have received littlemethodological attention and are frequently misinterpreted. 2. Weassessed the reliability of SW by performingmodel selection and averaging on simulated data sets includ- ing variables strongly and weakly correlated to the response variable and a variable unrelated to the response. Our aim was to investigate howusefulSWsare to inform about the relative importance of predictor variables. 3. SW can take a wide range of possible values, even for predictor variables unrelated to the response. As a con- sequence, SW with intermediate values cannot be confidently interpreted as denoting importance for the consid- ered predictor variable. Increasing sample size using an alternative information criterion for model selection or using only a subset of candidatemodels for model averaging did not qualitatively change our results: a variable of a given effect size can take awide range of SW values. 4. Contrary to what is assumed in many ecological studies, it seems hazardous to define a threshold for SW above which a variable is considered as having a statistical effect on the response and SW is not a measure of effect size. Although we did not consider every possible condition of analysis, it is likely that in most situations, SW is a poor estimate of variable's importance.},

abstract = {Evolutionary change results from selection acting on genetic variation. For migration to be successful, many different aspects of an animal's physiology and behaviour need to function in a co-coordinated way. Changes in one migratory trait are therefore likely to be accompanied by changes in other migratory and life-history traits. At present, we have some knowledge of the pressures that operate at the various stages of migration, but we know very little about the extent of genetic variation in various aspects of the migratory syndrome. As a consequence, our ability to predict which species is capable of what kind of evolutionary change, and at which rate, is limited. Here, we review how our evolutionary understanding of migration may benefit from taking a quantitative-genetic approach and present a framework for studying the causes of phenotypic variation. We review past research, that has mainly studied single migratory traits in captive birds, and discuss how this work could be extended to study genetic variation in the wild and to account for genetic correlations and correlated selection. In the future, reaction-norm approaches may become very important, as they allow the study of genetic and environmental effects on phenotypic expression within a single framework, as well as of their interactions. We advocate making more use of repeated measurements on single individuals to study the causes of among-individual variation in the wild, as they are easier to obtain than data on relatives and can provide valuable information for identifying and selecting traits. This approach will be particularly informative if it involves systematic testing of individuals under different environmental conditions. We propose extending this research agenda by using optimality models to predict levels of variation and covariation among traits and constraints. This may help us to select traits in which we might expect genetic variation, and to identify the most informative environmental axes. We also recommend an expansion of the passerine model, as this model does not apply to birds, like geese, where cultural transmission of spatio-temporal information is an important determinant of migration patterns and their variation.},

abstract = {Understanding how individuals use key resources is critical for effective conservation of a population. The Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) in western Alaska is the most important postbreeding staging area for shorebirds in the subarctic North Pacific, yet little is known about movements of shorebirds there during the postbreeding period. To address this information gap, we studied residency times and patterns of movement of 17 adult and 17 juvenile radio-marked Dunlin (Calidris alpina) on the YKD between early August and early October 2005. Throughout this postbreeding period, during which Dunlin were molting, most birds were relocated within a 130 km radius of their capture site on the YKD, but three birds were relocated more than 600 km to the south at estuaries along the Alaska Peninsula. On average, juvenile Dunlin were relocated farther away from the banding site (median relocation distance = 36.3 km) than adult Dunlin (median relocation distance = 8.8 km). Post-capture, minimum lengths of stay by Dunlin on the YKD were not significantly different between juveniles (median = 19 days) and adults (median = 23 days), with some birds staging for more than 50 days. Body mass at time of capture was the best single variable explaining length of stay on the YKD, with average length of stay decreasing by 2.5 days per additional gram of body mass at time of capture. Conservation efforts for postbreeding shorebirds should consider patterns of resource use that may differ not only by age cohort but also by individual condition.},

abstract = {It is well documented that plant and animal phenology is changing in response to recent climate warming in the Palaearctic. However, few long-term data sets are currently available in the Mediterranean basin. The present study reports long-term temporal trends of several phenophases of 45 plants, 4 insects and 6 migratory insectivorous birds. Dynamic factor analyses performed with plant phenophases showed that most of those events occurring at spring and summer had common trends toward the advancement, especially since mid-1970s. However, during these last decades, insect phenology showed a steeper advance than plant phenology, suggesting an increase of decoupling of some plant-insect interactions, such as those between pollinators and flowers or herbivorous insects and their plant resources. All trans-Saharan bird species showed highly significant temporal trends in all studied phenophases (some of them covering most of the last century). In two species, the duration of stay is increasing due to both earlier arrivals and later departures. On the other hand, two wintering species showed a significant advancement in their arrival dates, while an opposite pattern were found for departures of each one. Only one of these species increased significantly its wintering stay. Bird departures were not related to local climate in any species. Our results demonstrate a key role of local temperatures behind interannual variability of most plant and insects phenophases, with especial emphasis in those occurring in spring and summer. Therefore, the common signal towards the advancement recorded since mid-1970s resulted from the recent rise in temperatures.},

abstract = {We analyzed data from two surveys of fall migrating shorebirds in central and eastern North America to estimate annual trends in means per survey and to determine whether trends indicate a change in population size or might have been caused by other factors. The analysis showed a broad decline in means per survey in Atlantic Canada and the northeastern United States (North Atlantic region). For example, 9 of 9 significant trends in this region were {\textless} 1 (P=0.004), and the mean, annual rate of change among 30 species was 0.9783, a decline of -2.17{\%} per year (P {\textless} 0.001). Trends in the midwestern United States (Midwest region) showed no clear pattern. The mean among 29 species was 1.0090 (P=0.35). Only 4 of the trends were significant. Several hypotheses were evaluated to identify causes of the declining means per survey in the North Atlantic region. The most likely hypothesis appears to be a decline in the breeding populations that supply migrants to the North Atlantic region, but a change in movements, for example passing through the region more quickly in recent years, cannot be excluded as an explanation. Further surveys of arctic breeding areas coupled with analysis of long-term survey data from western North America would be helpful in determining whether the declines found in this analysis are also occurring in other areas.},

abstract = {The selective benefits of living in groups may increase with group size but this will depend on predator species or hunting mode. We tested whether the strength of selection for flock size in redshanks, Tringa totanus, depended on hunting mode used by sparrowhawks, Accipiter nisus, and peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus. Sparrowhawks prefer to ambush prey from cover, whereas peregrines normally attack from the open and use aerial pursuit. The success rate of surprise attacks should always decline with group size because of vigilance effects, and so should be similar for both predators. The success rate of nonsurprise attacks should decline with group size for peregrines because confusion effects apply, but not necessarily for sparrowhawks which quickly give up their chase. Consequently, peregrines should be more likely to attack smaller flocks than sparrowhawks to minimize confusion. Observations of 895 attacks, including 120 captures, confirmed these predictions. The decline in success rate with group size was the same for both predators for surprise attacks but was seen only for peregrines for nonsurprise attacks. Sparrowhawks attacked larger flocks than peregrines, although both species attacked small flocks with similar frequency. Our results suggest that the selective benefits of group size depend both on predator type and hunting mode, we assume because of variation in the importance of vigilance and confusion, and on relative predator abundance. Changes in prey group size may then change the strength of selection on vigilance and confusion effects by altering the relative attack frequency by different predators.

abstract = {1. We measured prey selection and habitat profitability of common eiders Somateria mollissima L. wintering in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Quebec, Canada. Prey selection was evaluated by comparing the frequency of prey in stomachs of shot eiders with their frequency in the sublittoral zone. Habitat profitability was estimated using information on time spent feeding, foraging success, diving durations and energy content of the prey. 2. In this region, eiders forage on a variety of prey types from several distinct habitats, kelp beds, urchin barrens and beds of the phaeophyte Agarum cribrosum (Mert.). In kelp beds eiders feed mostly on small blue mussels Mytilus edulis L. Over barrens they capture green sea urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (Muller), and over Agarum beds they feed on both spider crabs Hyas araneus (L.) and urchins. 3. Flock size also varies with habitat type: all sizes of flocks feed in the kelp beds, whereas mostly small flocks feed in the barrens and Agarum beds. Small-flock individuals strongly select mussels and crabs whereas urchins are non-preferred prey. 4. Dive and foraging cycles differ significantly according to the above three habitats. Although, the size, density and energy content of prey differ markedly between kelp and Agarum beds, these two habitats offer an even energy return. However, the variance in energy return in these two habitats differs strikingly, being greater in the latter. We hypothesized, in the context of risk foraging theory, that this was related to flock sizes and body condition. As predicted, individuals feeding in small flocks were in bad condition compared to individuals feeding in large flocks. This suggests that small-flock individuals are seeking the habitat offering a variable intake to improve their survival probability.},

abstract = {Despite an increase in conservation efforts for shorebirds, there are widespread declines of many species of North American shorebirds. We wanted to know whether these declines would be exacerbated by climate change, and whether relatively secure species might become at–risk species. Virtually all of the shorebird species breeding in the USA and Canada are migratory, which means climate change could affect extinction risk via changes on the breeding, wintering, and/or migratory refueling grounds, and that ecological synchronicities could be disrupted at multiple sites. To predict the effects of climate change on shorebird extinction risks, we created a categorical risk model complementary to that used by Partners–in–Flight and the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan. The model is based on anticipated changes in breeding, migration, and wintering habitat, degree of dependence on ecological synchronicities, migration distance, and degree of specialization on breeding, migration, or wintering habitat. We evaluated 49 species, and for 3 species we evaluated 2 distinct populations each, and found that 47 (90{\%}) taxa are predicted to experience an increase in risk of extinction. No species was reclassified into a lower–risk category, although 6 species had at least one risk factor decrease in association with climate change. The number of species that changed risk categories in our assessment is sensitive to how much of an effect of climate change is required to cause the shift, but even at its least sensitive, 20 species were at the highest risk category for extinction. Based on our results it appears that shorebirds are likely to be highly vulnerable to climate change. Finally, we discuss both how our approach can be integrated with existing risk assessments and potential future directions for predicting change in extinction risk due to climate change. Citation:},

abstract = {The reproductive success of colonially breeding species depends in part
upon a trade-off between the benefit of a dilution effect against
nestling predation within larger colonies and colony conspicuousness.
However, there may be no net survivorship benefit of dilution if smaller
colonies are sufficiently inconspicuous. This raises the question about
how the size distribution of breeding colonies on a landscape might
change as the predation danger for nestlings changes. In southwest
British Columbia, Canada, bald eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus
populations have increased exponentially at similar to 5{\%} per year in
recent decades and prey upon nestlings of colonial breeding great blue
herons Ardea herodias faninni. Motivated by field data on reproductive
success in relation to colony size, modeling is used to ask under which
circumstances trading off a dilution benefit against colony
conspicuousness can improve population reproductive success. That is,
which colonial nesting distribution, dispersed and cryptic versus
clumped and conspicuous, best mitigates predation danger on nestlings?
When predators are territorial, the modeling predicts a dispersed
nesting strategy as attack rate increases, but not as predator numbers
increase. When predators are non-territorial, the modeling predicts a
dispersed nesting strategy as predator numbers and/or attack rates
increase. When predators are both territorial and non-territorial,
colonial nesting within a predator's territory improves reproductive
success when attack rates are low. This suggests nesting in association
with territorial predators may offer decreased levels of predation when
compared with nesting amongst non-territorial predators. Thus a change
in the colony size distribution of colonially breeding species might be
anticipated on a landscape experiencing a change in predation danger.},

abstract = {Exposure to solar radiation and tidal inundation are important factors for a wide variety of chemical and ecological processes in coastal ecosystems. Accurate quantification of these factors is often difficult on a local scale. To address this research gap, a remote-sensing approach was developed to model inundation and radiation characteristics within an intertidal zone located in the Minas Basin (Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Canada). A light detection and ranging (LIDAR)derived elevation model was subjected to tidal modelling based on hourly sea level predictions and solar modelling based on sunrise and sunset times for 2009. Model results indicated an intertidal zone of 145.8 km2 with an elevation between 26.9 m and 6.8 m. The intertidal zone was determined to contain three unique wetland classes: (1) 4.4 km2 alterniflora; and (3) 63.1 km2 of high salt marsh, dominated by Spartina patens;(2) 5.0km2 of nonvegetated marine flat (73.3 km2 of low salt marsh, dominated by Spartina unclassified intertidal). Detailed exposure characteristics were calculated for each of the classes within the intertidal zone at 10-cm vertical intervals. Exposure calculations for 2009 showed that an average of 4.2 km2 exposed to the atmosphere each hour. Similarly, 11.7 km2 of salt marsh were exposed to solar radiation and 8.4 km2 of marine flat were exposed to solar radiation and 22.9 km2 were were exposed to the atmosphere each hour. The developed remote-sensing techniques successfully established intertidal zones, uniquely identified wetland classes, and modelled inundation and solar exposure characteristics within the study area.},

abstract = {Many estimation and inference problems arising from large-scale animal surveys are focused on developing an understanding of patterns in abundance or occurrence of a species based on spatially referenced count data. One fundamental challenge, then, is that it is generally not feasible to completely enumerate (“census”) all individuals present in each sample unit. This observation bias may consist of several components, including spatial coverage bias (not all individuals in the population are exposed to sampling) and detection bias (exposed individuals may go undetected). Thus, observations are biased for the state variable (abundance, occupancy) that is the object of inference. Moreover, data are often sparse for most observation locations, requiring consideration of methods for spatially aggregating or otherwise combining sparse data among sample units. The development of methods that unify spatial statistical models with models accommodating non-detection is necessary to resolve important spatial inference problems based on animal survey data. In this paper, we develop a novel hierarchical spatial model for estimation of abundance and occurrence from survey data wherein detection is imperfect. Our application is focused on spatial inference problems in the Swiss Survey of Common Breeding Birds. The observation model for the survey data is specified conditional on the unknown quadrat population size, N(s). We augment the observation model with a spatial process model for N(s), describing the spatial variation in abundance of the species. The model includes explicit sources of variation in habitat structure (forest, elevation) and latent variation in the form of a correlated spatial process. This provides a model-based framework for combining the spatially referenced samples while at the same time yielding a unified treatment of estimation problems involving both abundance and occurrence. We provide a Bayesian framework for analysis and prediction based on the integrated likelihood, and we use the model to obtain estimates of abundance and occurrence maps for the European Jay (Garrulus glandarius), a widespread, elusive, forest bird. The naive national abundance estimate ignoring imperfect detection and incomplete quadrat coverage was 77 766 territories. Accounting for imperfect detection added approximately 18 000 territories, and adjusting for coverage bias added another 131 000 territories to yield a fully corrected estimate of the national total of about 227 000 territories. This is approximately three times as high as previous estimates that assume every territory is detected in each quadrat. Read More: http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/06-0912.1},

abstract = {Electrocution on overhead power structures negatively affects avian populations in diverse ecosystems worldwide, contributes to the endangerment of raptor populations in Europe and Africa, and is a major driver of legal action against electric utilities in North America. We investigated factors associated with avian electrocutions so poles that are likely to electrocute a bird can be identified and retrofitted prior to causing avian mortality. We used historical data from southern California to identify patterns of avian electrocution by voltage, month, and year to identify species most often killed by electrocution in our study area and to develop a predictive model that compared poles where an avian electrocution was known to have occurred (electrocution poles) with poles where no known electrocution occurred (comparison poles). We chose variables that could be quantified by personnel with little training in ornithology or electric systems. Electrocutions were more common at distribution voltages (≤ 33 kV) and during breeding seasons and were more commonly reported after a retrofitting program began. Red-tailed Hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) (n = 265) and American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) (n = 258) were the most commonly electrocuted species. In the predictive model, 4 of 14 candidate variables were required to distinguish electrocution poles from comparison poles: number of jumpers (short wires connecting energized equipment), number of primary conductors, presence of grounding, and presence of unforested unpaved areas as the dominant nearby land cover. When tested against a sample of poles not used to build the model, our model distributed poles relatively normally across electrocution-risk values and identified the average risk as higher for electrocution poles relative to comparison poles. Our model can be used to reduce avian electrocutions through proactive identification and targeting of high-risk poles for retrofitting.},

This has often led to a lack of concern and understanding by the local people, and the protected savannas have continued to decline through uncontrolled fires, grazing animals, agriculture and logging.

abstract = {Predation has major impacts on survival and reproductive success for many species. To quantify these effect, ecologists often choose to intensively study prey populations to measure predation rates and/or estimate predator abundance. but in some cases, predation rates are less strongly related to predator abundance per se tha to spatial and temporal patterns of predator space use; thus, quantifying the latter may provide meaningful surrogates of predation rates that scale up to larger areas. this is particularly true when safety for prey, especially sessile and vulnerable prey, is strongly linked to predator-free space. Our own research programs have used two general types of behavioral indicators to quantify space use by predators: giving-up-densities, as a surrogate for patch quitting harvest rates, and activity density. We discuss two general mechanisms to behavioral indicators that can be easily collected in the field. We then summarize our past work on predation on passerine nests and moth pupae to demonstrate how using behavioral indicators of space use can reveal much about the impact of a predator on its prey. We demonstrate that behavioral indicators can be used for the following: (1) leading indicators for predation rates, (2) surrogates for information otherwise difficult to obtain, (3) integrative measures of the strength of species interactions, and (4) to reveal the outcomes of ecological interactions, such as prey persistence.},

abstract = {Declines in avian populations are a global concern, particularly for species that migrate between Arctic-temperate and tropical locations. Long-term population studies offer opportunities to detect and document ecological effects attributable to long-term climatic cycles such as the El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In this study, we report possible population-level effects of such climatic cycles on shorebird species that use two non-breeding season sites in Ecuador (Santa Elena peninsula area, near La Libertad). During our 9-year study period (1991/1992-1999/2000), there was a particularly strong ENSO warm phase event during 1997/1998. Population trend data for three species of shorebird, Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri), Semipalmated Sandpipers (C. pusilla), and Least Sandpipers (C. minutilla), indicated abundances generally declined during the 1990s, but there was an increase in the proportion of first-year birds and their abundance in the years following the 1997/1998 ENSO warm phase. There was some support for variation in apparent survivorship associated with the onset of the ENSO warm phase event in our population models, based on capture-mark-recapture data. Following the 1997/1998 ENSO event onset, individuals for all three species were significantly lighter during the non-breeding season (F1,3789 = 6.6, p = 0.01). Least-squares mean mass (controlling for size, sex and day of capture) for first-year birds dropped significantly more than for adults following ENSO (first-year mass loss = 0.69 ± 0.12 g; adult mass loss = 0.34 ± 0.11 g, F1,3789 = 5.31, p = 0.021), and least-squares mean mass dropped most during the period when sandpipers prepare for northward migration by gaining mass and moulting into breeding plumage. Least Sandpipers may have declined the most in mean mass following ENSO (0.76 ± 0.19 g), whereas Semipalmated Sandpipers were 0.52 ± 0.12 g lighter, and Western Sandpipers 0.40 ± 0.13 g lighter, but overall variation among species before (1992/1993-1996/1997) and after (1997/1998-1999/2000) ENSO was not significant (F2,3787 = 1.52, p = 0.22). Anomalously warm and wet conditions associated with strong ENSO warm phases during the non-breeding season may either act directly on shorebirds (increasing metabolic demands) and/or indirectly through reductions in prey availability. Reduced mass and mass gain may explain lower survivorship, particularly in adults, which are more likely to migrate northward in the spring than are first-year birds, at least in Western Sandpipers. Our results suggest a potential mechanism selecting for life history strategies suitable for withstanding long-term fluctuating climatic cycles such as ENSO. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Eurasian woodcock (Scolopax rusticola) over-wintering in northern Spain follows a pattern of daily movement from diurnal sites in woodlands to nighttime sites in grazed fields, congruent with previous reports on other European populations. Fields have a much higher abundance and biomass of earthworms, the main prey of woodcock, than woodlands, but are only used by birds at night, when they emerge about 30 minutes after sunset. Emergence time was quite uniform among fortnightly periods except for the second half of November when it was earlier, probably reflecting extended activity resulting from the higher energy requirements of migrating birds. Woodcock emergence time relative to sunset was negatively related to illumination, so that birds moved earlier when the sky was overcast. Also, birds tended to move earlier at low air temperatures, a pattern which is to be predicted since woodcock have higher energy requirements at low temperatures because of the increased cost of thermoregulation. Emerging late, at low light intensity, avoids exposure to raptors but results in reduced energy gains and therefore the timing of moving to feeding fields may be modified by energy considerations. We discuss the idea that there is a divergent spatio-temporal gradient of food and safety between woodlands and fields and, therefore, that predation risk is an important determinant of the timing of evening emergence of over-wintering woodcock. Thus, their daily activity cycle would reflect a trade-off between feeding and predator avoidance. Special features of the visual fields of the woodcock, allowing detection of predators at long distances, and chemoreceptors in the bill enabling detec- tion and capture of prey by probing using non visual cues, comprise adaptations that facilitate successful feeding at night with reduced predation risk.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to test whether the directional distributions found in ringing recoveries could be explained if night-migrating passerines use only a simple clock-and-compass strategy during autumn migration. I developed a mathematical model that predicts the expected directional distributions as a function of distance covered by birds using a clock-and-compass strategy. The predictions were compared with data from natural migration: all ringing recoveries of pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, ringed in Scandinavia and recovered elsewhere in Europe and North Africa within the same autumn. The predictions of the model correlated strongly with the distribution of ringing recoveries. This suggests that at least young pied flycatchers, and perhaps night-migrating passerines in general, use a simple clock-and-compass strategy to reach their wintering area. If so, all the prerequisites (a compass and an internal clock) that they need to orient during migration seem to be known at present, at least at the behavioural level, and navigational abilities or any elusive map-sense are not needed for migration.

abstract = {Migrating animals often divide their journey into alternating phases of migration bouts and stopping over. For investigating many questions of migration ecology it is crucial (1) to estimate the duration of stopover phases, and (2) to test whether animals of different groups differ in their stopover behavior. Using recent advances in capture-recapture statistics, we show how total stopover duration can be estimated from capture-recapture data. The probabilities of immigration are estimated and modeled by recruitment analysis and are converted into the time the animals spent at the stopover place before capture; the probabilities of emigration are estimated and modeled by survival analysis and are converted into the time the animals spent at the stopover place after capture. The sum of the two parts is the total stopover duration. Tests for differences between groups can be addressed by an appropriate model selection procedure. Two examples of migrating passerine birds at a stopover site in Switzerland illustrate this method. Mean total stopover duration was 12.3 d for Reed Warblers and 7.1 d for Reed Buntings. This was considerably higher than values obtained by the minimum stopover duration estimation (6.0 and 4.4 d, respectively). Because of the fundamental weaknesses of the minimum stopover duration estimation, which has been widely used in migration ecology, many findings obtained by this method need to be reconsidered.},

abstract = {Incomplete knowledge of the variation in site quality to be encountered during migration may make it necessary for birds to base their departure decisions on behavioural rules of thumb. Here I analyse four such rules for time-minimizers and show how they perform in spatially heterogeneous, autocorrelated environments. The first rule projects the currently experienced fuelling rate onto all the future sites, the second rule is based on a fixed expected rate along the route, the third rule assumes that the expected rate at sites nearby is close to the value currently experienced and the fourth rule uses the experienced values to form an expectation during migration. Simulations demonstrate that a global update rule which uses the current experience and interprets it as the global value to be expected at all the future sites is outperforming the second rule, which is based on fixed expectations, in nearly all circumstances and that it is very robust with respect to spatial autocorrelation and the degree of variability in fuelling rates. This rule leads to the repeatedly observed pattern of a shallow relationship between departure fuel load and fuel deposition rate. A third rule shows its best performance under the assumption that the quality of sites only changes little with distance and therefore comes close to the global update rule. The fourth departure rule, a modified version of the global update rule, which allows some adjustments of the expected value through all the experienced values so far, leads only to small increases in performance.

abstract = {The term 'short-stopping' is increasingly used in ecology to describe spatio-temporal changes in occurrence of migratory species. Spurred by the insight that it has been used in a variety of contexts, we reviewed its use in avian ecology. A literature search yielded 59 papers explicitly treating short-stopping in birds, most of them in peer-reviewed journals. The term was first used in 1967 to describe a northward shift in wintering Canada Geese in North America and has been used with increasing frequency to the present day. Geese dominate the short-stopping literature, which is confined to the northern hemisphere. Short-stopping has been used to describe (1) a shortened autumn migration that results in a wintering distribution closer to breeding areas, (2) a shortened spring migration that results in a breeding distribution closer to wintering areas, and (3) a delay in autumn migration that leads to a perceived reduced abundance in some part of the winter range. We advocate that short-stopping should be used only to describe (1) range shifts that involve shortening of the migratory corridor, and that they are qualified explicitly by season (i.e. breeding/winter) and degree (i.e. full or partial range shift). In other cases of breeding, wintering or entire range shifts where the migratory corridor is elongated or remains the same, we recommend using the term 'range shift', qualified by season, geography and orientation (i.e. the direction of the range shift). We also discuss the need for spatially explicit avian count monitoring mechanisms (rather than capture-recapture or hunting bag data) designed specifically to track such changes in distribution in the future.},

abstract = {One of the world's largest citizen science projects is eBird, a database that has been used primarily to address questions of bird distributions and abundance over large spatial scales. However, addressing finer-scale questions is also possible, depending on survey coverage and whether assumptions and limitations are matched to the scale of inferences. Our objective was to determine if the eBird database could be used to develop estimates of bird abundance and diversity comparable to those from standardized shorebird surveys.We compared a year of standardized shorebird surveys by trained observers at Snook Islands Natural Area located in Palm Beach County, Florida, to a year of eBird observations from the same site. Total species richness derived fromeBird (25 species) was higher than that from standardized surveys (20 species). Similarly, we found the Shannon diversity index calculated from eBird was higher (2.81) than the same index calculated from standardized surveys (2.21; P {\textless} 0.001). The higher diversity and species richness may reflect the greater effort of eBird participants (35,289 person-hours) compared to our standard surveys (2126 person-hours).We found only a slight difference in parameter estimates between data obtained fromeBird and fromstandardized surveys. Potential use and value of eBird as a tool for land managers and conservationists may be greater than currently realized, but studies conducted in a wider range of ecosystems and locations are needed to develop generalizations.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: A major challenge to ecologists is identifying factors that make a system susceptible to regime shifts or state transitions. Theory and modelling have suggested a number of indicators to warn of approaching tipping points, but empirical tests of their validity are few. We tested 2 indicators, change to a key species and increased temporal variability, in a harbour, a system type rarely studied for regime shifts and alternate states. Long-term monitoring over 20 yr on a number of intertidal sandflats allowed us to document change and determine potential contributing factors. We detected decreasing abundance in the key species and increased temporal variability (flickering) of community composition before a trophic and functional change to an alternate community type. Detection of these indicators occurred despite cyclic patterns in community and population dynamics and a relatively fast and permanent change of one external condition (nutrients). We provide evidence that this shift was the product of a relatively small change in management of sewage disposal, combined with climate dynamics and mediated through changes in a key species, a tubeworm that provides biogenic habitat structure, stabilises sediment and affects dispersal and recruitment. These factors all interacted to escalate the effect of the relatively small changes in nutrients across a tipping point.},

Adults, which made up 68{\%} of all individuals in mixed-age flocks, were the first or "lead" birds in 80{\%} of these flocks. Most (58{\%} adults migrated in the first, or leading, half of such flocks, and most (68{\%}) juvenilles migrated in the trailing half.

abstract = {Foraging speed is a key determinant of fitness affecting both foraging success and predator attack survival. In a scramble for food, for instance, evolutionary stable strategy models predict that speed should increase with competitor density and decrease when the risk of attack by predators increases. Foraging speed should also decrease in richer food patches where the level of competition is reduced. I tested these predictions in fall staging flocks of semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) foraging for an evasive prey. Capture rate of these prey decreased with sandpiper density as the presence of competitors reduced the availability of resources for those behind. Foraging speed was evaluated indirectly by measuring the time needed to cross fixed boundaries on mudflats over 6 years. As predicted, foraging speed increased with sandpiper density and decreased with food density, but, unexpectedly, increased closer to obstructive cover where predation risk was deemed higher. When foraging closer to cover, from where predators launch surprise attacks, the increase in foraging speed may compensate for an increase in false alarms that interrupted foraging. While foraging in denser flocks decreases foraging success, joining such flocks may also increase safety against predators. In semipalmated sandpipers that occupy an intermediate position in the food chain, foraging behavior is influenced simultaneously by the evasive responses of their prey and by the risk of attack from their own predators.},

I outline a basic model of provisioning, based on central place foraging, in which the forager must spend some extra time on each excursion to gather enough energy to cover the excursion's energetic costs. I describe studies of provisioning pertinent to this framework, consider risk-sensitive provisioning, and use the ideas to develop a model that explores the previously-unasked question of when provisioners should deliver whole prey, and when they should deliver processed prey (e.g. the stomach oil of some procellariforms). I also discuss the role of predation danger in provisioning, its implications for parent-offspring conflict, and conclude by considering the question of how hard provisioners should work.},

abstract = {Rhythmic movements in response to tidal cycles are characteristic of infaunal inhabitant of intertidal soft-bottoms, allowing them to remain in the area with best living conditions. The effect of bioturbators as modifier of local environmental conditions and thus of gradients in intertidal habitats, has not been investigated yet. The Atlantic estuarine intertidal areas are dominated by the burrowing crab Chasmagnathus granulatus that generates strong environmental heterogeneity by affecting the physical-chemical characteristics of the sediment. The comparison between intertidal areas with and without crab shows that sediments in the crab beds remain more humid, softer, and homogeneous across the intertidal and along the tidal cycle than areas without crabs. The densities of infauna were higher at high intertidal zones in crab beds than in similar areas without crabs. Infaunal organisms performed vertical movements into the sediment following the tidal cycle that were always of higher magnitude in habitats without crabs. Infaunal species tend to spend most of the time buried into the sediment in the crab bed. Migratory shorebirds use the Atlantic estuarine environments as stopover or wintering sites. They feed (mainly on polychaetes) in the low intertidal zones of both habitats (with and without crabs), but they also feed in the upper intertidal of the crab bed; polychaete per capita mortality rate is higher in the upper part of the crab bed. Environmental heterogeneity produced by crab disturbance has an effect on the infaunal behavior, risk of mortality, and the zonation pattern. This is another example of the ecosystem engineering ability of a burrowing intertidal species.},

We studied autumn migrating juvenile Blue Tits (Parus caeruleus) and investigated whether molting birds showed signs of diseases or physiological stress to a larger degree than non-molting individuals, There was no evidence that molting birds were more stressed than non-molting individuals, as hematocrit, red blood cell sedimentation rate and the size of subcutaneous fat stores were similar for birds in both groups. However, birds with high levels of subcutaneous fat had low sedimentation rate levels and high hematocrit values, indicating that the level of fat of an individual is associated with its state of health. Birds with large fat stores were more brightly colored than birds with smaller fat stores, suggesting a link between nutritional conditions experienced during molt and the size of fat stores during the subsequent migration. Taken together, our data indicate that fat deposit size in migrating birds might be affected by their current health status, as well as conditions experienced during molt.},

abstract = {There is mounting evidence that global climate change has extended growing seasons, changed distribution patterns, and altered the phenology of flowering, breeding, and migration. For migratory birds, the timing of arrival on breeding territories and over-wintering grounds is a key determinant of reproductive success, survivorship, and fitness. But we know little of the factors controlling earlier passage in long-distance migrants. Over the past 30 years in Oxfordshire, U.K., the average arrival and departure dates of 20 migrant bird species have both advanced by 8 days; consequently, the overall residence time in Oxfordshire has remained unchanged. The timing of arrival has advanced in relation to increasing winter temperatures in sub-Saharan Africa, whereas the timing of departure has advanced after elevated summer temperatures in Oxfordshire. This finding demonstrates that migratory phenology is quite likely to be affected by global climate change and links events in tropical winter quarters with those in temperate breeding areas.},

abstract = {The Galapagos Archipelago has long been considered a living laboratory for the study of evolution. Due to geographic isolation and speciation many endemic animal and plant groups have radiated on the islands. Although the vertebrate fauna of these islands (e.g. giant tortoises, Darwin's finches) has been studied in great detail, little is known about invertebrates and especially insects. Results are given of a population genetic study on the phytophagous beetle Nesaecrepida darwini. This small alticine beetle is present on all major islands but shows a discontinuous population distribution. To obtain population genetic information we used cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis to study allozyme variation in 6 populations from 3 islands. Twelve presumptive loci, including 9 polymorphic ones, were analysed The results show low heterozygosity values, with the lowest genetic diversity on the youngest island. F-statistics (mean F-ST = 0.431) indicate a very large amount of genetic differentiation between populations. Hierarchical analysis indicates little inter- island gene flow but also considerable genetic variation between populations occurring on the same island. These results strongly suggest a metapopulation structure with recurrent extinctions and recolonisations of populations within each island. Recent field observations support these findings.},

abstract = {Climate change is predicted to be the major threat to biodiversity by 2100, when the global average temperature may increase by 5-6 degrees, according to current predictions and trends in greenhouse gas emissions. However, many impacts of climate change on biodiversity have already been observed. These observed effects provide tangible evidence to motivate action to mitigate against further climate change. Focusing on Europe, this overview summarises recently published observed impacts of modern climate change on birds. Due to the sensitivity of birds to weather fluctuations, the high numbers of ornithologists throughout Europe and the tradition in the long-term study of bird populations, there is no doubt that climate change impacts on birds have already occurred. These impacts include changes in (i) phenology (e.g., breeding times), (ii) migration patterns (e.g., time of spring arrival from the wintering grounds), (iii) species distribution (e.g., poleward shift of range margins) and (iv) abundances (e.g., population declines of habitat-specialist birds). Although the overall evidence available is comprehensive, there is a challenge in disentangling the effects of climate change from those of other concurrent factors such as habitat loss and degradation, e.g. due to large-scale intensification of agriculture. Birds are coping with climate change by means of their phenotypic plasticity, but little evidence is available to prove that evolutionary adaptation is already taking place. Further climate change is likely to affect birds at many levels, from changes in body size to shifts in assemblage composition, from mismatches with their resources to the introduction of exotic species and new diseases: the interactions among these levels need to be considered in future research and to devise effective conservation strategies. The rapid development of this key topic in conservation biology and applied ecology makes it important to ensure long-term funding for research, review and dissemination.},

abstract = {In estuarine sediment fiats benthic macroinvertebrates are intensively consumed by a variety of predators, such as aquatic birds and nekton (mostly fish and crustaceans). However, there is still a lack of conclusive studies that evaluate if this predation has a relevant impact on the populations of those invertebrates, which are a key element of the estuarine food chain. In the Tagus estuary we experimentally tested and quantified the impact of predation on the polychaete Hediste diversicolor, one of the most important prey for a variety of predators in many estuaries. Using an exclusion experiment, we compared the seasonal variation in the densities of H. diversicolor from February to November in sediment plots (1) available to both bird and nekton predators, (2) just to nekton, and (3) without predators. We also followed changes in the abundance of potential predators throughout the study. The lowest densities were systematically observed in the plots accessible to all predators, followed by those which excluded just birds, and finally by those that excluded all predators. The exclosures were in place for 9 months, at the end of which the average density of H. diversicolor in the plots protected from all predators was eight times greater than in those without any protection. These results demonstrate that predation had a major impact on the densities of H. diversicolor. The relative importance of bird and nekton predation varied along the study, and this seems to be determined by different peaks of abundance of the two types of predators. However, when present in high densities, birds and nekton seem to have a similar impact on H. diversicolor. Our results suggest that predation is a key factor on the population dynamics of H. diversicolor. In addition, the levels of predation that we observed suggest that this polychaete can be a limited resource, and this could have major ecological consequences for predators for which it is a key prey.

abstract = {The relative contribution of personal and social information to explain individual and collective behavior in different species and contexts is an open question in animal ecology. In particular, there is a major lack of studies combining theoretical and empirical approaches to test the relative relevance of different hypothesized individual behaviors to predict empirical collective patterns. We used an individual-based model to confront three hypotheses about the information transfer between social scavengers (Griffon Vultures, Gyps fulvus) when searching for carrion: (1) Vultures only use personal information during foraging ("nonsocial" hypothesis); (2) they create long chains of vultures by following both other vultures that are flying towards carcasses and vultures that are following other vultures that are flying towards carcasses ("chains of vultures" hypothesis); and (3) vultures are only attracted by other vultures that are sinking vertically to a carcass ("local enhancement" hypothesis). The chains of vultures hypothesis has been used in existing models, but never been confronted with field data. Testing is important, though, because these hypotheses could have different management implications. The model was parameterized to mimic the behavior and the densities of both Griffon Vultures and carcasses in a 10 000-km2 study area in northeastern Spain. We compared the number of vultures attending simulated carcasses with those attending 25 continuously monitored experimental carcasses in the field. Social hypotheses outperformed the nonsocial hypothesis. The chains of vultures hypothesis overestimated the number of vultures feeding on carcasses; the local enhancement hypothesis fitted closely to the empirical data. Supported by our results, we discuss mechanistic and adaptive considerations that reveal that local enhancement may be the key social mechanism behind collective foraging in this and likely other avian scavengers and/or social birds. It also highlights the current need for more studies confronting alternative models of key behaviors with empirical patterns in order to understand how collective behavior emerges in animal societies.},

abstract = {Plasma lipid metabolites may be useful indicators of mass changes in migratory birds. To test utility of plasma metabolites in field studies, we examined effects of several extrinsic (bleed time, time of day, location) and intrinsic (body mass, sex, age, migratory state) factors on plasma concentrations of triglycerides (TRIG), glycerol (GLYC), and B-OH-butyrate (BUTY) in free-living Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri). TRIG and GLYC decreased rapidly following capture (2-20 min), whereas BUTY did not change. GLYC and BUTY were negatively correlated to body mass. TRIG was positively correlated to body mass in migrant females, but not consistently in migrant males, or in females captured on the wintering grounds. Taking into account other sources of variation, the two measures of lipid utilization (GLYC and BUTY) varied little through the year. TRIG showed the greatest potential for use in field studies. TRIG was lowest during winter, when birds were leanest, and highest during spring and fall migration, when sandpipers were gaining mass rapidly at stopovers. TRIG differed between sandpipers refuelling a two stopover sites separated by 35 km, demonstrating that populations of birds can have characteristic lipid metabolite profiles that may reflect local differences in fattening rate.

abstract = {Shorebirds represent a highly diverse group of species, many of which experience tremendous energy demands associated with long-distance migratory flights. Transcontinental migrants are dependent upon dynamic freshwater wetlands for stopover resources essential for replenishment of lipid reserves and completion of migration. Patterns of shorebird migration across midcontinental wetlands were detected from migration reports to American Birds and information provided by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service national wildlife refuges. Patterns in species composition and abundance varied geographically, emphasizing the uniqueness of different regions to migrating shorebirds. Smaller species and neotropical migrants moved primarily across the Great Plains, whereas larger species and North American migrants predominated in assemblages in the intermountain west. Shorebirds were broadly dispersed in wetland habitats with dynamic water regimes. Whereas populations of shorebirds in coastal systems appear to concentrate at sites of seasonally predictable and abundant food resources, we propose that transcontinental shorebirds disperse and use wetlands opportunistically. This migration system exemplifies the need for large-scale, coordinated regional management efforts that recognize the dynamic nature of ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {The Western Sandpiper (Calidris mauri) is one of the most common shorebirds in the western hemisphere, with a global population of about of 3-3.5 million birds. The species breeds primarily in western Alaska, and spends the non-breeding season along the Pacific coast from California to Peril, and the Atlantic coast from North Carolina to Surinam. The largest concentrations occur in northwestern Mexico and in Panama. Males spend the winter farther north than females and juveniles are disproportionately represented on the northern and southern edges of the distribution. We recently documented a latitudinal difference in life-history tactics of wintering Western Sandpiper. In northwestern Mexico, nearly all sandpipers prepare for northward migration by gaining mass and molting into alternate plumage. In Panama, most adults, but few, if any, first-year birds do so. Instead, they spend their yearling summer in predominantly basic plumage on the non-breeding grounds. To compensate for not breeding during their first year, we expected more southerly birds to have higher survivorship rates. As predicted, mark-recapture studies show that the apparent annual survival rate of male western sandpipers at Punta Banda, Mexico was lower than that in Chitre, Panama (phi = 0.48 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.54 +/- 0.10). We suggest that costs and benefits associated with migratory distance have altered the life-history strategies for sandpipers spending the non-breeding season at different latitudes.},

abstract = {Predicting the dynamics of natural food webs requires estimates of the strength of interactions among species. The ability to estimate per capita interaction strength from observational data is desirable because of the logistical difficulty of using experimental manipulations to obtain such measures for all species within complex natural communities. In this paper, I derive observational measures of per capita interaction strength having units matching those of dynamic food web models (per capita consumption and assimilation rates). I also highlight the difference between per capita interaction strength (a parameter used in theoretical models) and species impact (empirical measures of total species effect). I then use behavioral observations and population censuses in a rocky intertidal community to estimate both per capita interaction strengths and species impacts on invertebrate prey of Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens), American Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), and Northwestern Crows (Corvus caurinus). Estimated per capita interaction strengths exhibited a skewed distribution with many weak interactions and few strong interactions: mean +/- 1 SD of log(10)(interaction strength) = -1.95 +/- 1.40 (bird-day/m of shore)(-1). Per capita interaction strength correlated poorly (r(2) = 0.152-0.157) and nonlinearly with both consumption rates and percentage contribution of a prey species to the diet. Using my observational estimates of per capita interaction strengths, I predicted the species impact of bird predation on different prey taxa. Predictions included strong effects of birds on goose barnacles (Pollicipes polymerus), limpets (Lottia and Tectura spp.), sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus spp.), and large starfish (Pycnopodia helianthoides and Solaster stimpsoni), but little effect on mussels (Mytilus californianus and M. trossulus), dogwhelk snails (Nucella spp.), and acorn barnacles (Semibalanus cariosus). I compared nine of the predictions with 126 results of experimental manipulations of birds. The predictions agreed both qualitatively and quantitatively with the experimental results.

abstract = {Understanding stopover decisions of long-distance migratory birds is crucial for conservation and management of these species along their migratory flyway. Recently, an increasing number of Barnacle geese breeding in the Russian Arctic have delayed their departure from their wintering site in The Netherlands by approximately one month and have reduced their staging duration at stopover sites in the Baltic accordingly. Consequently, this extended stay increases agricultural damage in The Netherlands. Using a dynamic state variable approach we explored three hypotheses about the underlying causes of these changes in migratory behavior, possibly related to changes in (i) onset of spring, (ii) potential intake rates and (iii) predation danger at wintering and stopover sites. Our simulations showed that the observed advance in onset of spring contradicts the observed delay of departure, whereas both increased predation danger and decreased intake rates in the Baltic can explain the delay. Decreased intake rates are expected as a result of increased competition for food in the growing Barnacle goose population. However, the effect of predation danger in the model was particularly strong, and we hypothesize that Barnacle geese avoid Baltic stopover sites as a response to the rapidly increasing number of avian predators in the area. Therefore, danger should be considered as an important factor influencing Barnacle goose migratory behavior, and receive more attention in empirical studies.},

abstract = {1.Declines in migratory species have been linked to anthropogenic climate change through phenological mismatch, which arises due to asynchronies between the timing of life-history events (such as migration) and the phenology of available resources. Long-distance migratory species may be particularly vulnerable to phenological change in their breeding ranges, since the timing of migration departure is based on environmental cues at distant non-breeding sites. 2.Migrants may, however, be able to adjust migration speed en route to the breeding grounds and thus ability of migrants to update their timing of migration may depend critically on stopover frequency during migration; however, understanding how migratory strategy influences population dynamics is hindered by a lack of predictive models explicitly linking habitat quality to demography and movement patterns throughout the migratory cycle. 3.Here, we present a novel modelling framework, the Migratory Flow Network (MFN), in which the seasonally varying attractiveness of breeding, winter, and stopover regions drives the direction and timing of migration based on a simple general flux law. 4.We use the MFN to investigate how populations respond to shifts in breeding site phenology based on their frequency of stopover and ability to detect and adapt to these changes. 5.With perfect knowledge of advancing phenology, 'jump' migrants (low frequency stopover) require more adaptation for populations to recover than 'hop' and 'skip' (high or medium frequency stopover) migrants. If adaptation depends on proximity, hop and skip migrants' populations can recover but jump migrants cannot adjust and decline severely. 6.These results highlight the importance of understanding migratory strategies and maintaining high-quality stopover habitat to buffer migratory populations from climate-induced mismatch. 7.We discuss how MFNs could be applied to diverse migratory taxa, and highlight the potential of MFNs as a tool for exploring how migrants respond to other environmental changes such as habitat loss.

abstract = {Shallow-feeding shorebirds, dowitchers (Limnodromus griseus and L. scolopaceus), western sandpipers (Calidris mauri), dunlin (C. alpina) and American avocets (Recurvirostra americana), reduced the density of their prey in mudflats with little sand but not in mudflats with a moderate admixture of sand. An experiment in Upper Newport Bay, Southern California, during October and November 1979 to explain the difference in density is described. The effect of sand on shorebird feeding was compared in the field by measuring the times spent feeding in plots where sand had or had not been added, respectively. Increasing the sand content to 14{\%} from 2{\%} in the top centimeter decreased the time spent in treated plots by all species compared to adjacent untreated plots. The prey species were small polychaete and oligochaete worms (0.25 to 1.25 mm wide) similar in diameter to sand grains (0.5 to 1.0 mm). In plots where sand had been added, avocets fed by pecking at the surface in addition to scything, the more common method of feeding on muddy substrates. The results suggest that sand interferes with the detection and or capture of prey that are similar in diameter to small sand grains and explains the differences in the effects of predation by these birds seen on mudflats with a moderate admixture of sand compared to the effects on mudflats with little sand. Differential success in prey capture between one microhabitat and the nest (rather than a reduction in competition, as suggested by some authors) might explain the different use of such habitats},

abstract = {This study reports on experiments on falcons wearing miniature videocameras mounted on their backs or heads while pursuing flying prey. Videos of hunts by a gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus), gyrfalcon (F. rusticolus)/Saker falcon (F. cherrug) hybrids and peregrine falcons (F. peregrinus) were analyzed to determine apparent prey positions on their visual fields during pursuits. These video data were then interpreted using computer simulations of pursuit steering laws observed in insects and mammals. A comparison of the empirical and modeling data indicates that falcons use cues due to the apparent motion of prey on the falcon's visual field to track and capture flying prey via a form of motion camouflage. The falcons also were found to maintain their prey's image at visual angles consistent with using their shallow fovea. These results should prove relevant for understanding the co-evolution of pursuit and evasion, as well as the development of computer models of predation and the integration of sensory and locomotion systems in biomimetic robots.},

During the next decade the advection rate increased from 10 to 13 cm/s between Newfoundland and Iceland Basin.

    abstract = { One consequence of climate change is an increasing mismatch between timing of food requirements and food availability. Such a mismatch is primarily expected in avian long-distance migrants because of their complex annual cycle, and in habitats with a seasonal food peak. Here we show that insectivorous long-distance migrant species in The Netherlands declined strongly (1984–2004) in forests, a habitat characterized by a short spring food peak, but that they did not decline in less seasonal marshes. Also, within generalist long-distance migrant species, populations declined more strongly in forests than in marshes. Forest-inhabiting migrant species arriving latest in spring declined most sharply, probably because their mismatch with the peak in food supply is greatest. Residents and short-distance migrants had non-declining populations in both habitats, suggesting that habitat quality did not deteriorate. Habitat-related differences in trends were most probably caused by climate change because at a European scale, long-distance migrants in forests declined more severely in western Europe, where springs have become considerably warmer, when compared with northern Europe, where temperatures during spring arrival and breeding have increased less. Our results suggest that trophic mismatches may have become a major cause for population declines in long-distance migrants in highly seasonal habitats. }

abstract = {1. Previous theoretical models of the effect of sexual selection on average individual fitness in a population have mostly predicted that sexually selected populations should adapt faster and clear deleterious mutations more quickly than populations where sexual selection is not operating. 2. While some laboratory studies have supported these predictions, others have not and stud- ies of field systems have tended to find negative effects of sexual selection, or no effect. The negative effects of sexual selection found in field and other studies are usually ascribed to the costs associated with strong sexual selection acting on the population. 3. Here, using an individual-based model that allows feedback between demographic and evolutionary processes, we find that sexual selection can lead to both increases and decreases in population-level fitness measures such as extinction probability and adaptation rate. Whether fitness increases or decreases depends on a variety of environmental and demo- graphic factors including the nature of environmental change, the carrying capacity of the environment, the average fecundity of the population in question and the strength of condi- tion dependence. 4. In many cases, our model predicts that sexual selection leads to higher extinction probabil- ity in small populations because of an increased risk of demographic stochasticity, but lower extinction probability in larger populations because of faster adaptation rates. This is consis- tent with field studies that have mostly focussed on very small populations such as recently introduced birds, and tend to find negative effects, and also with laboratory studies that tend to use larger populations and have tended to find positive effects. 5. These findings go at least some way towards an understanding of the apparent contradic- tions between theoretical predictions, laboratory studies and field data.},

abstract = {The contrasting histories of the western and eastern shores of the North Atlantic Ocean provide an excellent opportunity to consider the implications of past events for present ecological processes and the functioning of marine ecosystems. Similarities and differences in assemblage composition have been driven by large-scale events, such as the trans-Arctic interchange, which has shaped the species pool, and cycles of glaciation, which have determined phases of local or regional extinction and colonization. More recently, anthropogenically induced invasions and local extinctions have significantly altered biogeographic distributions. Here we consider for both hard and soft substrata how the presence or absence of key taxa influences the outcomes of trophic and other biological interactions, and evaluate the consequences for community structure and ecosystem functioning. On intertidal hard substratum shores, biodiversity of epilithic microphagous grazers differs across latitudinal and longitudinal scales. Diversity is high in southern Europe but declines to the north and across the Atlantic. Lower diversity and the absence of patellid limpets in Iceland and the northwest Atlantic compared to Europe result in differences in consumer pressure, and an apparent contrast in the importance of herbivory vs. competitive interactions and predation pressure as community structuring processes. Interestingly, despite differences in "process,'' community patterns are remarkably similar between the east and west. On soft sediment shores, there are conspicuous geographic differences in importance of bioturbators and large digging predators. Hemichordates can be abundant and important infaunal bioturbators in the western Atlantic, but they generally play a much reduced role in the eastern Atlantic. In addition, the number and diversity of digging predators on western Atlantic shores is high; the horseshoe crab, swimming portunid crabs, large whelks, excavating waterfowl, and an abundance of skates and rays exert intense predation pressure and associated biogenic disturbance to sediments. In Europe, except for excavating waterfowl these taxa are rare or absent. Thus, the importance of large, biological agents of disturbance is lower on European shores as a consequence of both recent anthropogenic pressure and natural processes over larger time scales. Consideration of key structuring taxa over the Atlantic shows that human-mediated transport has had considerable influence. Faunas on both sides of the Atlantic are becoming more similar to the point that some of the key differences in assemblage composition and hence community organization have blurred. Recent introductions as well as planned experimental manipulations provide the opportunity to understand the role of species identity in determining community structure and ecosystem functioning over large spatial scales; the North Atlantic may be an ideal test system to explore these areas.},

abstract = {Dendritic tidal creek networks are important habitats for sustaining biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in salt marsh wetlands. To evaluate the importance of creek heterogeneity in supporting benthic secondary production, we assess the spatial distribution and secondary production of a representative polychaete species (Dentinephtys glabra) in creek networks along a stream-order gradient in a Yangtze River estuarine marsh. Density, biomass, and secondary production of polychaetes were found to be highest in intermediate order creeks. In high order (3rd and 4th) creeks, the density and biomass of D. glabra were higher in creek edge sites than in creek bottom sites, whereas the reverse was true for low order (1st and 2nd) creeks. Secondary production was highest in 2nd order creeks (559.7 mg AFDM m-2 year-1) and was ca. 2 folds higher than in 1st and 4th order creeks. Top fitting AIC models indicated that the secondary production of D. glabra was mainly associated with geomorphological characters including cross-sectional area and bank slope. This suggests that hydrodynamic forces are essential factors influencing secondary production of macrobenthos in salt marshes. This study emphasizes the importance of microhabitat variability when evaluating secondary production and ecosystem functions.},

abstract = {Behavioral decisions made by migrating songbirds may depend on a variety of biotic and abiotic factors. To investigate which factors most infl uence songbird behavior on stopover, we related departure and directional decisions of captive birds released at the capture site to a variety of factors including, weather, date, energetic condition, age, sex, and species. We captured spring migrants during the day, released them after sunset, and visually assessed whether they departed the study site and if so, in which direction. Departure was strongly infl uenced by wind direction and energetic condition, especially fat stores. Th e proportion of birds departing increased as the season progressed. Directional decisions were also strongly infl uenced by energetic condition, particularly fat stores and plasma triglyceride levels. Wind direction also infl uenced the direction in which birds made migratory fl ights. While energetic condition, stage of migration, and weather seem to be important proximate determinants in departure and directional decisions, habitat availability and other factors may also need to be considered.},

abstract = {Birds breeding in the Arctic must carefully balance survival and reproduction because of the often extreme environmental conditions and the very brief breeding season. Acute elevation of plasma corticosterone is one mechanism that birds apparently use to alter the balance in favor of survival at the expense of reproduction when faced with stressors such as storms, predators, or low food availability. To examine this relationship, we applied a standardized stressor, capture and handling, to four species of shorebirds (Scolopacidae) during their breeding season in the Arctic and measured the increase in corticosterone between 3 min and 30 min after capture (hereafter called the stress response). We tested two hypotheses in an effort to explain the individual variation observed in the stress response. The first hypothesis states that individuals most responsible for parental care have a lower stress response than individuals less responsible for parental care. In species with uniparental care (Pectoral Sandpiper Calidris melanotos, Red Phalarope Phalaropus fulicaria), the caregivers had a lower stress response than the opposite sex, although in the latter species the difference was not significant (P = 0.016 and P = 0.102, respectively). In a species with equal biparental care (Semipalmated Sandpiper C. pusilla), the stress response did not differ between the sexes (P = 0.99, Barrow population). In a species with unequal biparental care (Western Sandpiper C. mauri), the more parental sex (males) had a much lower stress response than the less parental sex (P = 0.002). The second hypothesis states that individuals breeding in the high Arctic have a lower stress response than individuals breeding in the low Arctic. The stress response in a low-Arctic population of Semipalmated Sandpipers (Nome) was higher than that in a high-Arctic population (Barrow, P {\textless} 0.05). Individuals at an additional high-Arctic location (Prudhoe Bay) exhibited stress responses most similar to those of the Barrow population (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Taken together, these results provide evidence of a mechanism that birds may use to breed in environments with a brief breeding season and under conditions that might be perceived as stressful, if not for their reduced sensitivity to potential stressors.},

abstract = {Decline of migrant wader populations worldwide implies that their demography may be affected by phenomena occurring in a large geographical scale. Knowledge about vital rates affecting population growth and viability helps in finding the processes behind the declines. We estimated the rate of population growth (lambda) of a dramatically declined population of Temminck's stints Calidris temminckii using a ten year capture-recapture data. We assessed the viability of the population by projections based on lambda and its variation. We also studied sensitivity of lambda to changes in vital rates (breeding success, recruitment and adult survival). Both adult and juvenile survival and breeding success were lower than c. 30 years earlier. Adult survival seemed to have dropped during the study period. Population growth appeared strongly negative and viability analyses predicted an almost certain extinction within a few decades. Adult survival formed the main component of the growth rate suggesting that population crash is mainly caused by a drop in adult survival. Still, sensitivity analyses showed that a moderate rise in adult survival or any other single vital rate would not make the population viable. Most probably, survival has dropped due to factors operating along migration routes and wintering areas, at sites shared by birds from other parts of the breeding range. Therefore, the observed population crash and decline in adult survival may indicate parallel changes in poorly monitored arctic populations. Migration habits (continental wide flyways and scattered wintering areas) imply that factors responsible for the drop in survival have a wide geographical range.},

The results show two distinct continental-scale patterns. First, the north to south progression of peak peregrine passage down the continent is readily apparent, occurring primarily during September and October. Second, the movement of Peregrine Falcons is earlier by 4-6 wk on the west coast than on the eastern seaboard, and is intermediate at inland sites. The wavefront of Peregrine Falcons advancing southward is oriented from southwest to northeast across the North American continent. We hypothesize that these patterns have implications for the southward migrations of potential prey species, which may select routes or times to avoid places of high risk due to Peregrine Falcons.},

abstract = {1. Shellfish of marketable size can be harvested much more quickly and efficiently using mechanical methods such as tractor-powered harvesters and suction dredgers than by traditional methods. The adverse effects of such machines on non-target organisms need to be considered carefully before licensing such activities. 2. A tractor-towed cockle harvester was used to extract cockles from intertidal plots of muddy sand and clean sand in order to investigate the effects on other benthic invertebrates and their predators. 3. Harvesting resulted in the loss of a significant proportion of the most common invertebrates from both areas, ranging in the muddy sand from 31{\%} of Scoloplos armiger (Polychaeta) (initial density 120 m(-2)) to 83{\%} of Pygospio elegans (Polychaeta) (initial density 1850 m(-2)). Significant effects could not be detected in most populations with a density of less than 100 m(-2). 4. Populations of Pygospio elegans and Hydrobia ulvae (Gastropoda) remained significantly depleted in the area of muddy sand for more than 100 days after harvesting, and Nephtys hombergi (Polychaeta), Scoloplos armiger and Bathyporeia pilosa (Amphipoda) for more than 50 days. 5. Invertebrate populations in clean sand with relatively few cockles Cerastoderma edule (Pelecypoda) recovered more quickly than those in muddy sand with a more structured community, which included several tube-dwelling species such as Pygospio elegans and Lanice conchilega (Polychaeta). 6. Bird feeding activity increased at first on the harvested areas, with gulls and waders taking advantage of invertebrates made available by harvesting. Subsequently, in the area of muddy sand, the level of bird activity declined compared with control areas. It remained significantly reduced in curlews Numenius arquata and gulls for more than 80 days after harvesting and in oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus for more than 50 days. 7. It is concluded from this study that tractor dredging for cockles in high density areas causes a sufficiently large mortality of non-target invertebrates that harvesters should be excluded from areas of conservation importance for intertidal communities such as invertebrates, fish and birds.},

Dunlins fed regularly by both day and night. However, they tended to utilize different habitats during daytime and night-time, with relatively more birds aggregating on soft sediment containing high densities of Corophium volutator at night. Pecking was the dominant foraging technique during the daytime, whereas probing was the preferred technique at night. Dropping analysis revealed quantitative differences between the birds' diurnal and nocturnal diets. It is proposed that nocturnal foraging may be important for restoring fat deposits in migrating birds.},

While our ability to identify abrupt regime shifts in natural ecosystems has improved, detection of potential early-warning signals previous to such shifts is still very limited. Using real monitoring data of a key ecosystem component, we here apply multiple early-warning indicators in order to assess their ability to forewarn a major ecosystem regime shift in the Central Baltic Sea. We show that some indicators and methods can result in clear early-warning signals, while other methods may have limited utility in ecosystem-based management as they show no or weak potential for early-warning. We therefore propose a multiple method approach for early detection of ecosystem regime shifts in monitoring data that may be useful in informing timely management actions in the face of ecosystem change.},

abstract = {During travel, migrants may encounter unfamiliar habitats and predators and visit sites for which they lack information on predation risk. Temporary stops during migration permit only limited opportunities to gather information about risk, and other priorities, such as the need to forage, may restrict these opportunities. Under these conditions, the extent to which migrants respond to variations in predation risk is unclear. We studied small passerine birds during migratory stopover to determine whether their behaviour was related to variation in risk of capture by migrating birds of prey. We used two approaches, observational and experimental. Observations revealed that blue-grey gnatcatchers, Polioptila caerulea, and American redstarts, Setophaga ruticilla, moved deeper into oak shrubs as the number of sharp-shinned hawks, Accipiter striatus, at the site increased. Furthermore, blue-grey gnatcatchers moved at slower rates as counts of hawks increased. The experiment revealed that blue-grey gnatcatchers had lower rates of both movement and foraging after exposure to a gliding model hawk. These results provide evidence that predator avoidance remains a priority during migration and that migrants are able to assess risk to some extent during temporary stopover. In addition, the results suggest that predator avoidance behaviour may limit foraging opportunities during stopover by restricting habitat use.

abstract = {The seasonal decline of avian clutch size may result from the conflict between the advantage of early breeding (greater offspring value) and the advantage of a delay in lay date (improved body condition and hence clutch size). We tested predictions of a condition-dependent individual optimization model based on this trade-off (Rowe et al. 1994) in a long-distance migrant, the greater snow goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica), using data on condition, migration, and reproductive decisions of individuals. We closely tracked radio-marked females at their main spring staging area and on their breeding grounds. Our results were consistent with predictions of the model. Early-arriving females had a longer prelaying period and initiated their nests earlier than late arrivals. After controlling statistically for arrival date, we determined that females with high premigration condition had an earlier lay date than those in low condition. After controlling for the seasonal decline (i.e., lay date), we observed that clutch size was not related to premigration condition. Moreover, we took advantage of an unplanned manipulation of the prebreeding condition that occurred during our long-term study. We found that a reduction in condition caused a delay in lay date. However, after controlling for the seasonal decline, it did not affect clutch size. Our study indicates that geese simultaneously adjust their lay date and clutch size according to their premigration condition and migratory behavior as predicted by the condition-dependent optimization model.},

abstract = {Economic hypotheses predict that prey in refuges after short-term encounters with predators decide how long to hide before emerging (hiding time) based on cost of emerging (predation risk) and cost of not emerging. Here, I report tests of predictions of these hypotheses for several cost of emerging and cost of remaining in refuge factors in the lizard Sceloporus virgatus by approaching lizards to elicit refuge entry, review tests of the predictions to evaluate the success of current models in predicting hiding time, and note parallels between models predicting hiding time and flight initiation distance (distance separating predator from prey when escape begins). Hiding times were longer under greater risk implied by faster, more direct, and repeated approaches and by greater proximity of the predator to the refuge during hiding. Lizards responded to costs of refuge use by emerging sooner when food was visible outside and when the refuge was substantially cooler than the lizard. In addition, lizards were more likely to enter refuges when approached rapidly and when cloudiness precluded effective thermoregulation by basking. Review of findings for lizards and other taxa revealed strong support for the predictions of cost-benefit models that hiding time increases with cost of emerging and decreases with cost of staying in refuge. Examination of parallel predictions by escape theory and refuge use theory emphasizes their fundamental similarity and led to identification of an untested prediction of refuge use theory.},

abstract = {Transitions in ecological systems often occur without apparent warning, and may represent shifts between alternative persistent states. Decreasing ecological resilience (the size of the basin of attraction around a stable state) can signal an impending transition, but this effect is difficult to measure in practice. Recent research has suggested that a decreasing rate of recovery from small perturbations (critical slowing down) is a good indicator of ecological resilience. Here we use analytical techniques to draw general conclusions about the conditions under which critical slowing down provides an early indicator of transitions in two-species predator–prey and competition models. The models exhibit three types of transition: the predator–prey model has a Hopf bifurcation and a transcritical bifurcation, and the competition model has two saddle-node bifurcations (in which case the system exhibits hysteresis) or two transcritical bifurcations, depending on the parameterisation. We find that critical slowing down is an earlier indicator of the Hopf bifurcation in predator–prey models in which prey are regulated by predation rather than by intrinsic density-dependent effects and an earlier indicator of transitions in competition models in which the dynamics of the rare species operate on slower timescales than the dynamics of the common species. These results lead directly to predictions for more complex multi-species systems, which can be tested using simulation models or real ecosystems.},

abstract = {Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla (L., 1766)) use the upper Bay of Fundy, Canada, as a critical stopover site during their annual fall migration to wintering grounds in South America. While in the area, they feed extensively on mudflat invertebrates. Historically the amphipod Corophium volutator (Pallas, 1766) has been thought to make up the majority of their diet. However, we have recently observed flexibility in foraging behaviour and prey selection by sandpipers. The extent of this flexibility and the current diet composition is unknown. To address these knowledge gaps, we assessed Semipalmated Sandpiper diets using stable isotope analyses of blood plasma and available prey items. Data were collected in two arms of the Bay of Fundy during summer 2009 and 2010. Diets fluctuated between years and sites, but in all cases the diet was much more diverse than previously thought. Polychaetes and biofilm made substantial contributions, and C. volutator was still present in the diet, but at much reduced levels than previously noted. This previously unrecognized inclusion of biofilm in the diet is consistent with recent observations of other calidrid shorebirds. Based on measures of prey availability, there is little evidence of preference for C. volutator.},

Factors that influence foraging benefits during migration stopover may influence fitness in a migratory species. The number of captures and success rate peaked during the middle of day regardless of temperature. Pecking rate decreased with increasing temperature while the number of captures and success rate increased suggesting that foraging benefits are lower at low temperatures. The number of captures and success rate did not change as a function of tide stage or time of year despite presumed changes in prey availability and/or density. Running and flying activities were also influenced by time of day and weather factors. Difficulties in locating prey or detecting predators may explain the effect of time of day and increased thermoregulation costs and changes in prey activity are probably involved in explaining how weather factors influence foraging behavior in this species.},

@article{Swanson2009,
abstract = {In apparent response to recent periods of global warming, some migratory birds now arrive earlier at stopover sites and breeding grounds. However, the effects of this warming on arrival times vary among locations and species. Migration timing is generally correlated with temperature, with earlier arrival during warm years than during cold years, so local variation in climate change might produce different effects on migration phenology in different geographic regions. We examined trends in first spring arrival dates (FADs) for 44 species of common migrant birds in South Dakota (1971-2006) and Minnesota (1964-2005) using observations compiled by South Dakota and Minnesota Ornithologists' Unions. We found significant trends in FAD over time for 20 species (18 arriving earlier and two later) in South Dakota and 16 species (all earlier) in Minnesota. Of these species, 10 showed similar significant trends for both states. All 10 of these species exhibited significantly earlier arrival, and all were early spring migrants, with median FADs before 10 April in both states. Eighteen of the 44 species showed significant negative correlations of FADs with either winter (December-February) or spring (arrival month plus previous month) temperatures in one or both states. Interestingly, spring temperatures in both South Dakota and Minnesota did not warm significantly from 1971-2006, but winter temperatures in both states warmed significantly over the same time period. This suggests that the warmer winters disproportionately affected early spring migrants, especially those associated with aquatic habitats (seven of the 10 species showing significantly earlier spring arrival in both states). The stronger response to climate change by early spring migrants in our study is consistent with the results of several other studies, and suggests that migrants, especially early migrants, are capable of responding to local temperature conditions experienced on wintering grounds or along the migration route.},

The method may be used with Breeding Bird Survey data, aerial surveys, point counts, or any other program of repeated surveys at permanent locations. Surveys need not be made at each location during each survey period. The method differs from most existing methods in being design based, rather than model based. The only assumptions are that the nominal sampling plan is followed and that sample size is large enough for use of the t-distribution. Simulations based on two bird data sets from natural populations showed that the point estimate produced by the linear model was essentially unbiased even when counts varied substantially and 25{\%} of the complete data set was missing. The estimating-equation approach, often used to analyze Breeding Bird Survey data, performed similarly on one data set but had substantial bias on the second data set, in which counts were highly variable. The advantages of the linear model are its simplicity, flexibility, and that it is self-weighting. A user-friendly computer program to carry out the calculations is available from the senior author.},

abstract = {The upper Bay of Fundy is a critical staging area for migrating semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla), which feed extensively on the amphipod Corophium volutator. Recent changes in. the distributions of birds around the bay have generated interest in understanding the factors that influence shorebirds' habitat use. To examine some of these factors, we surveyed four mud flats during summer 2000. Abundance of shorebirds and density of C. volutator and mud snails (Ilyanassa obsoleta) were assessed in two focused areas and on two broad-scale transects per mud flat. Shorebird abundance varied widely across sites, and was positively correlated with C. volutator availability, though the relationship had little predictive ability. A strong negative relationship was identified between shorebirds and mud snails counted before birds arrived, especially in the focused areas. This relationship probably stems from a negative effect of mud snails on C. volutator. Snails present in July may reduce recruitment of C. volutator, and therefore reduce the prey base for shorebirds arriving later in the summer. By considering mud snail abundance, we have identified a simple and effective method of predicting shorebird habitat use several weeks before birds arrive. This will enhance our ability to study these birds in future, and will contribute to our understanding of shorebird habitat use and movements and the importance of conserving particular mud flats.},

Management directed at conservation of these species can benefit from the use of simple population models such as matrix models. However, for many species, data on survival and reproduction are scarce. Therefore, we set up a general framework based on a matrix model with three parameters: reproduction, juvenile (=first year survival) and adult survival in which incomplete data can be analysed. This framework is applicable to species that can mature after their first year of life. The point in a calendar year at which the population size is determined, i.e. the census time, is varied. We discuss the differences and the similarities between matrices modelling the same population at different census times. The population growth rate and the elasticity of the survival and reproduction parameters have been determined analytically. From these we made, as a visual diagnostic tool (general framework), plots of the growth rate and the elasticity pattern and their dependence on actual values of the reproduction parameter and the juvenile and adult survival. To illustrate the use of this framework we plot and discuss literature data on survival and/or reproduction of a few bird species with a juvenile stage of one year in the light of our modelling results.},

abstract = {The shape and movement of the vocal tract are known to influence bird song. Current theory predicts that large bill and body size are correlated with low frequency song and slow trill rate. It is also widely accepted that song characteristics are important for mate choice by females. We investigated the relationship between bill morphology, song characteristics, and pairing success in Darwin's small tree finch Camarhynchus parvulus, on the Galapagos Islands. Contrary to predictions from a previous cross-species study on Darwin's finches, we found that individuals with larger bill size produced songs with slow trill rate, high dominant frequency, and broad frequency bandwidth, indicating that song is a reliable signal of bill morphology. Vocal performance as indicated by the deviation from an upper performance limit was higher in paired than unpaired males. Pairing was not skewed in favour of a particular bill size, and both small and large billed males that sang high performance song had high pairing success. The reliable signalling function of song has implications for female choice and territorial defence, given that both females and conspecific competitors can assess the relative size of males' bills through song, while females may use vocal performance as a signal of male quality.},

abstract = {We documented the local density and sex, age-class, and body size distributions of Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) among habitats at Bahia Santa Maria, northwestern Mexico, during the nonbreeding season. Three habitats were recognized: brackish flats, mangroves, and cattail marshes, which we ranked as richest to poorest in food resources and safest to most dangerous in predation danger. Western Sandpiper population structure differed among habitats. Bird densities were highest in brackish flats, the richest and safest habitat, and males and adults of both sexes were overrepresented. In cattail marshes, which appeared to be the poorest and most dangerous habitat, bird densities were lower, and the sex ratio and age ratios within each sex were more even. In mangroves, bird densities were similar to those in cattail marshes, but sex and age ratios were similar to those in brackish flats. Exposed culmen, an index of structural size, was not related to habitat use in either sex. Body mass of immature males was more variable than that of adults among habitats and immature males gained mass throughout the winter. Birds in brackish flats and mangroves were initially heavier, but tended to lose mass, whereas birds in cattail marshes were initially lighter, but tended to gain mass. Mass distributions thus converged in late winter. While the social and ecological causes and significance of differential sex and age-class distributions among habitats remain largely unquantified, evidence from this and previous studies suggests that nonbreeding population structure is a common phenomenon with important implications for migratory shorebirds.},

abstract = {Many shorebirds that breed in North America are declining. These trends reflect global patterns in shorebird populations. Here we ask what factors make some shorebird species more prone to decline than others. Specifically, we test the influence of migratory behaviour (route and distance), biogeography (population size and range), life history (body size, clutch size) and sexual selection (social mating system and testis size) on population trends in North American breeding shorebirds. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that species that migrate across continental North America are more prone to decline than species that do not. Our finding that continental migrants are associated with population decline indicates that intrinsic factors may play an important role in predisposing a species to decline. Previous studies within the class Aves have failed to identify migration route as a correlate of decline or extinction risk. Two other intrinsic factors (oceanic migrants and threats on the non-breeding grounds) were also important in our overall models, although neither was significant alone. The moderate explanatory power of our variables indicates that other factors are also important for explaining shorebird declines. We suggest that contemporary threats, most notably habitat loss and degradation at migratory stopover sites, are likely to be important.},

abstract = {The modern ecologist usually works in both the field and laboratory, uses statistics and computers, and often works with ecological concepts that are model-based, if not model-driven. How do we make the field and laboratory coherent? How do we link models and data? How do we use statistics to help experimentation? How do we integrate modeling and statistics? How do we confront multiple hypotheses with data and assign degrees of belief to different hypotheses? How do we deal with time series (in which data are linked from one measurement to the next) or put multiple sources of data into one inferential framework? These are the kinds of questions asked and answered by The Ecological Detective.Ray Hilborn and Marc Mangel investigate ecological data much as a detective would investigate a crime scene by trying different hypotheses until a coherent picture emerges. The book is not a set of pat statistical procedures but rather an approach. The Ecological Detective makes liberal use of computer programming for the generation of hypotheses, exploration of data, and the comparison of different models. The authors' attitude is one of exploration, both statistical and graphical. The background required is minimal, so that students with an undergraduate course in statistics and ecology can profitably add this work to their tool-kit for solving ecological problems.},

During the rise of behavioral ecology and sociology, researchers began to measure how often looked up form feeding. Subsequently, the field of vigilance crystallized quickly around a few striking results and an elegant theory. The convenient mathematical assumptions of this original theory continue to channel researchers' attentions today. Although data tend to match these assumptions - flock members scan independently, vigilance sequences are essentially unpredictable, and interscan intervals are highly variable - the assumptions themselves are difficult to justify. Some of our basic ideas about vigilance require detailed re-examination.},

abstract = {To manage and conserve wildlife populations effectively it is necessary to use methods that identify the often non-linear trends in populations, have an inbuilt assessment of trend quality and can analyse count data from a range of spatial scales. We present a method of trend analysis using generalised additive models. These produce smoothed indices of abundance that can be used to assess population change from one or more sites or time periods, with any number of estimates of abundance per index period. We apply this method to count data collected under the Wetland Bird Survey, a national scheme that monitors waterbirds in the United Kingdom. To highlight declining populations, 'alerts' were raised if the population decline was equal to or greater than 50{\%}. Significance was determined using bootstrapped confidence intervals for analyses that included many sites, or a novel Monte-Carlo method for single site analyses. The impact of missing data, species count variability and the number of months used to calculate the population change was greater at individual sites than for national datasets, which were relatively insensitive to changes in the above parameters. For single sites it is essential that three or more counts be made per index period if reliable estimates of population change are required. We propose that the method presented could be applied to a wide range of national or other monitoring schemes for a variety of taxa. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this review, we propose a new framework, dynamic disequilibrium of the carbon cycles, to assess future land carbon-sink dynamics. The framework recognizes internal ecosystem processes that drive the carbon cycle toward equilibrium, such as donor pool-dominated transfer; and external forces that create disequilibrium, such as disturbances and global change. Dynamic disequilibrium within one disturbance–recovery episode causes temporal changes in the carbon source and sink at yearly and decadal scales, but has no impacts on longer-term carbon sequestration unless disturbance regimes shift. Such shifts can result in long-term regional carbon loss or gain and be quantified by stochastic statistics for use in prognostic modeling. If the regime shifts result in ecosystem state changes in regions with large carbon reserves at risk, the global carbon cycle might be destabilized.},

Using information on turnover rates of radio-tagged Western Sandpipers, we estimated that about 101,000 small calidridine sandpipers used the Seal Creek-Ahmklin River estuary as a spring migration stopover annually in 1996 and 1997. From previous aerial survey data on shorebird distribution, we estimated that the entire Yakutat Forelands supports a spring population of more than 350,000 migrant shorebirds. Therefore, the forelands is an important stopover site to migratory shorebirds and should be included in the network of international stopover sites needed to conserve shorebirds migrating along the Pacific coast.},

abstract = {Recent shifts in the timing of migration and breeding have been   attributed to climate variation in some migratory birds. However, the   divergent patterns in the timing of autumn migration among different   bird species suggest a significant role of factors other than climate.   Using data of constant-effort catches, determinants for the annual   variation in the timing of migration were investigated in the Curlew   Sandpiper Calidris ferruginea in Poland. Variation in the timing for   adult and juvenile Curlew Sandpipers was influenced by breeding success,   which was in turn connected to predation pressure, and June and July   temperatures on the species' breeding grounds in the Arctic region.   Median date of passage of adults was significantly later in good than in   poor breeding years. The migration of adults was earlier by 2.3 days for   every 1 C increase in average June temperature in the Arctic breeding   grounds. Median migration date of juveniles was positively correlated   with predation and negatively with June temperature in the Arctic   breeding grounds. Median migration date of adults advanced by a factor   of -0.59 days/year, which translates into 10 days from 1984-2000. These   results suggest that conditions on breeding grounds can affect the   timing of subsequent events within the annual cycle. Circumstantial   evidence also suggests that climate change may have increased the   predation on young Curlew Sandpipers, increasing the frequency of poor   breeding years and modifying the timing of autumn migration in these   waders.},

abstract = {Understanding the ecology and evolution of migratory animals requires information on how populations are geographically linked between periods of the annual cycle. To examine whether trace elements could be used to track migratory birds, we analyzed concentrations of 42 trace elements in feathers of western sandpipers (Calidris mauri (Cabanis, 1857)) that were grown at five different wintering sites ranging from San Francisco Bay (USA) to the Bay of Panama. Linear discriminant analysis of 15 elements correctly classified all 26 individuals to their wintering sites, including two sites that were separated by less than 3 km. A randomization procedure confirmed the robustness of these findings. Our analysis suggests that trace elements can be used to assign individuals to specific sites of origin. Although we did not sample feathers from all wintering areas, the regions our sites represented comprised a significant percentage of the global population. However, since trace element profiles appear to be highly specific to geographic sites, we suggest that this technique is best suited for cases where samples can be obtained from the majority of populations throughout a species range. Thus, under certain circumstances, trace element profiles may provide the potential to identify populations with a high degree of spatial accuracy.},

Spatial changes in migration have been related to long-term temperature trends, but the intrinsic mechanisms by which migratory species adapt to environmental change remain largely unexplored. We show that, for a long-lived social species, older birds with more experience are critical for innovating new migration behaviours. Groups containing older, more experienced individuals establish new overwintering sites closer to the breeding grounds, leading to a rapid population-level shift in migration patterns. Furthermore, these new overwintering sites are in areas where changes in climate have increased temperatures and where food availability from agriculture is high, creating favourable conditions for overwintering. Our results reveal that the age structure of populations is critical for the behavioural mechanisms that allow species to adapt to global change, particularly for long-lived animals, where changes in behaviour can occur faster than evolution.},

abstract = {The decline of long distance migratory songbirds has been linked to an increasing mismatch between spring arrival date and timing of food availability caused by climate change. It is unclear to what extent individuals can adjust migration timing or en route rate in response to annual variation in temperature at breeding sites. We tracked the ca. 7300 km spring migration of 52 purple martins Progne subis from the Amazon basin to two breeding sites in eastern North America. Spring 2012 was the warmest on record in eastern North America, but contrary to predictions, this did not result in earlier departure, faster migration, or earlier arrival at breeding areas compared with earlier years. Temperatures and rainfall in the Amazon basin at the time of departure were not higher in 2012, and conditions along migration routes did not give consistent signals of a warmer spring at the breeding site. Once in North America, individuals likely had limited opportunity to speed up their migration because this final portion of the journey was already very rapid ( 570 km/d; 4-5 d in duration). Migration timing over the entire journey was best predicted by breeding latitude and sex and was not sensitive to ecological cues (temperature and rainfall amount) at departure from South American overwintering sites or en route, in contrast to recent studies of other songbirds. Our results provide the first direct evidence for a mismatch between higher spring temperatures at breeding sites and departure schedules of individual songbirds, and suggest phenotypic responses to short-term climatic warming may be limited for some species. Further direct-tracking data with greater geographic and temporal scope is needed to test for individual plasticity in response to temperature and rainfall along migratory routes for this, and other, species.},

If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

abstract = {Avian migration, which involves billions of birds flying vast distances, is known to influence all aspects of avian life. Here we investigate how birds fit moult into an annual cycle determined by the need to migrate. Large variation exists in moulting patterns in relation to migration: for instance, moult can occur after breeding in the summer or after arrival in the wintering quarters. Here we use an optimal annual routine model to investigate why this variation exists. The modelled bird's decisions depend on the time of year, its energy reserves, breeding status, experience, flight feather quality and location. Our results suggest that the temporal and spatial variations in food are an important influence on a migratory bird's annual cycle. Summer moult occurs when food has a high peak on the breeding site in the summer, but it is less seasonal elsewhere. Winter moult occurs if there is a short period of high food availability in summer and a strong winter peak at different locations (i.e. the food is very seasonal but in opposite phase on these areas). This finding might explain why only long-distance migrants have a winter moult.},

abstract = {Redshanks Tringa totanus that are preyed upon by Sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus at the Tyninghame Estuary, Firth of Forth, Scotland, provide an example of how the starvation-predation risk trade-off results in mortality. In this trade-off, animals cannot always optimize anti-predation behaviour because anti-predation behaviours, such as avoiding predators, are usually incompatible with foraging behaviours that might maximize intake rates. Therefore, as animals compensate for starvation risk, predation risk increases. Sparrowhawks are the main direct cause of death in Redshanks at Tyninghame. Sparrowhawk attack rate is determined by Redshank vulnerability, and vulnerability decreases as group size and distance to cover increase, and probably as spacing decreases. But reduction of predation vulnerability reduces feeding rate because areas away from cover are less food-profitable and grouping results in increased interference competition. Increased starvation risk in midwinter means Redshanks are forced to feed on highly profitable prey, Orchestia amphipods, the behaviour of which means that Redshanks are forced to feed vulnerably, in widely spaced groups, close to predator-concealing cover. Therefore, it is the constraints that limit the ability of Redshanks to feed in large, dense flocks away from cover that ultimately lead to mortality. We investigate this hypothesis further by testing the prediction that mortality can be predicted directly by cold weather and population density. We demonstrate that the overall number of Redshanks and the proportion of Redshanks killed increase in cold months when controlling for population size. We also demonstrate that the proportion of Redshanks killed increases when there are fewer Redshanks present, because the success rate of hunting Sparrowhawks increases, probably because effective management of predation risk through flocking is constrained by a low population size. Redshanks therefore provide an example of how directly mortality caused by predation arises from starvation risk and other constraints that prevent animals from optimizing anti-predation behaviour.},

abstract = {The impact of predators is often relative to the spatial scale at which the study is conducted. In this paper we investigated how spatial scale might influence the importance of predation. In doing this we addressed the hypothesis of scale-dependency in predation experiments. The predator studied was the shore crab, Carcinus maenas (L.), and its impact on intertidal macrofauna communities was assessed using a caging experiment. Two different treatments, small and large enclosure cages (of, respectively, 0.25 and 1 m(2)), were established in a completely randomised design on two different sites, mud and muddy sand, which differed physically but were very similar biologically. The density of crabs per square metre was 48, much larger than the ambient density but comparable with previously published work. The experiment ran for a month and the resulting data and summary statistics were analysed using univariate and multivariate methods. Results indicate that the impacts of crab predation were similar in the different cage sizes but different on the different sites. The present work demonstrates the importance of scale in interpreting the results of caging experiments, but not at the small-scale level of cage size. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science BN.

abstract = {Spring temperatures in temperate regions have increased over the past 20 years, and many organisms have responded to this increase by advancing the date of their growth and reproduction. Here we show that adaptation to climate change in a long-distance migrant is constrained by the timing of its migratory journey. For long-distance migrants climate change may advance the phenology of their breeding areas, but the timing of some species' spring migration relies on endogenous rhythms that are not affected by climate change. Thus, the spring migration of these species will not advance even though they need to arrive earlier on their breeding grounds to breed at the appropriate time. We show that the migratory pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca has advanced its laying date over the past 20 years. This temporal shift has been insufficient, however, as indicated by increased selection for earlier breeding over the same period. The shift is hampered by its spring arrival date, which has not advanced. Some of the numerous long-distance migrants will suffer from climate change, because either their migration strategy is unaffected by climate change, or the climate in breeding and wintering areas are changing at different speeds, preventing adequate adaptation.},

abstract = {Isolation from predators affects prey behavior, morphology, and life his- tory, but there is tremendous variation in the time course of these responses. Previous hypotheses to explain this variation have limited predictive ability. I develop a ‘multipredator' hypothesis to explain the evolutionary persistence of antipredator behavior after the loss of some, but not all, of a species' predators. The hypothesis assumes pleiotropy, whereby elements of antipredator behavior may function in non-predat- ory situations, and linkage, such that genes influencing the expression of antipredator behavior do not assort independently. The hypothesis is restricted to species with multiple predators (most species) and aims to predict the conditions under which antipredator behavior will persist following the loss of one or more of a species' predators. I acknowledge that the relative costs of non-functional antipredator behavior will influ- ence the likelihood of linkage and therefore persistence. The hypothesis makes two main predictions. First, genes responsible for antipredator behavior will not be scattered throughout the genome but rather may be found close together on the same chromosome(s). Secondly, the presence of any predators may be sufficient to maintain antipredator behavior for missing predators. Advances in behavioral genetics will allow tests of the first prediction, while studies of geographic variation in antipredator behavior provide some support for the second.},

abstract = {Conservation objectives aimed at maintaining the diversity of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are often expressed as a desire to ensure that spawner abundance is spread out over a number of spawning sites. However, sampling is not usually possible at all sites or in all years. For such incomplete data sets, rotating panel sampling designs and hierarchical estimation models have been suggested as ways to improve monitoring performance. To evaluate the potential benefits of using these approaches to assess the conservation status of coho salmon (O. kisutch), we developed a simulation procedure that modelled spatial and temporal variation in salmon abundance at multiple sites within a region. Results show that both approaches were largely unsuccessful at reducing classification errors for conservation status. Furthermore, indicators describing distributions of abundance levels and temporal trends in abundance within a region were more sensitive to missing data than to observation error variance on annual abundance estimates. Thus, sampling effort might be better spent reducing the level of missing data within a regional data set, as opposed to obtaining more precise estimates for only a few site-year combinations. Our results also show that the best monitoring plans for regions depend on monitoring objectives as well as the relative magnitudes of spatial and temporal variability.},

abstract = {The study of stopover sites has received a lot of attention in avian ecology, being especially important for many long-distance migrants, some of which have to pause several times during migration. The survival of many migratory birds depends primarily on food availability at these stopovers. However, previous studies show that there is a lack of knowledge about site selection where migratory birds stop to refuel energy stores. In the present study, a Bayesian expert system has been used to incorporate environmental parameters, to determine their relationship with the presence of barnacle geese at stopover sites. Data on stopover sites was obtained from satellite-tracked barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) for three different breeding populations in the Western Palearctic (i.e. Russian, Svalbard and Greenland). The results from the present study showed that the posterior probability of presence at the stopover sites obtained from the Bayesian model was close to one. Therefore, the Bayesian expert system detected the stopover sites of the geese correctly and can be used as a proper method for modelling the presence of barnacle geese at the stopover sites in the future. This study introduces a new method into movement ecology to identify and predict the importance of different environmental parameters for stopover site selection by migratory geese. This is particularly important from both a conservation and an agro-economic point of view with the goal of reducing possible conflicts between geese and agricultural interests.},

@article{Cresswell2011,
abstract = {One of the classic ecological questions is how predators affect population size. This is often assessed by measuring how many individuals are killed by a predator, yet such direct effects may only be a relatively minor part of population dynamics. Predators frequently affect prey populations indirectly, with the fear of predation resulting in costly behavioural compensation that has the potential to lead to large population and community effects. Large observable lethal effects may then just represent the most easily observed "special" cases of the effects of predation on populations, with the costs of non-lethal effects being ubiquitous and usually dominant. This review explores these two ideas: that both cases where there are no population effects due to predation and those where lethal effects dominate are unusual and involve special circumstances. First, systems in which predation effects appear not to arise include (1) complete avoidance of predators by prey; (2) when other environmental factors limit populations so that predation is not additive to mortality; (3) when there are other more vulnerable prey for a predator; (4) when predators interact; (5) because the relationship of perceived predation risk with predator abundance is usually a non-linear function; (6) for the simple reason that non-lethal effects have not been considered. Second, lethal effects tend to dominate over non-lethal effects when (1) there is a high cost of compensating for predation risk associated with either a resource constraint or a particularly vulnerable niche or life-history stage (e.g. the nest stage generally for birds); (2) prey are the most popular prey of a predator or linear trophic chains operate; (3) there is evolutionary lag, such as introduced predators and na {\textless} ve prey populations; (4) there are several predator species hunting the same prey in diverse ways. The presence of predators may or may not affect the size of a bird population at any particular life-history stage, although in most cases it will do so through non-lethal effects and, occasionally, through lethal effects. However, the presence of predators will always affect intra- and interspecific competition and so will always affect population dynamics. Studies that wish to fully demonstrate that predation has no effect on bird populations must show that lethal effects and the costs of non-lethal compensation by the prey do not significantly change its density and, consequently, the level of competition.},

We rely on a multistage Beverton-Holt model to describe the production of salmon from one life stage to the next. We use information from the literature to construct relationships between the physical environment and the necessary productivity and capacity parameters for the model. As an example of how policy makers can use the model in recovery planning, we applied the model to a threatened population of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Snohomish River basin in Puget Sound, Washington, USA. By incorporating additional data on hatchery operations and harvest management for Snohomish River basin stocks, we show how proposed actions to improve physical habitat throughout the basin translate into projected improvements in four important population attributes: abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and life-history diversity. We also describe how to adapt the model to a variety of other management applications.},

abstract = {Intact migratory routes are critical for the stability of forest-dwelling, neotropical, migratory bird populations, and mortality along migratory pathways may be significant. Yet we know almost nothing about the geography of available stopovers or the possible migratory pathways that connect optimal stopovers. We undertake a spatial analysis of stopover habitat availability and then model potential migratory pathways between optimal stopovers in the eastern United States. Using models of fixed orientation and fixed nightly flight distance between stopovers during spring migration, we explore whether a simple endogenous migratory program is sufficient to ensure successful migration across the modern landscape. Our model runs suggest that the modern distribution of optimum stopovers in the eastern United States can be adequately exploited by birds following migratory pathways defined by fixed-orientation and fixed-distance nightly flights. Longer flight distances may increase the chances of success by enabling migrants to bypass locales offering little habitat. Our results also suggest that most southwest–northeast migratory pathways through the Appalachian mountains are intact. Lack of optimal habitat at key locations in the Southeast causes many modeled pathways to fail. We present a speculative view of regional migration patterns implied by predominant ideas found in stopover ecology literature, and demonstrate the need for broad-scale migration research, in the hope that our approach will foster other continental- and regional-scale projects.},

American Avocets spent 41-50{\%} of their time feeding and 34-40{\%} of their time sleeping during each season. All four species spent minimal time engaged in locomotion, body maintenance, alert, and aggressive behaviors. American Avocets and Lone-billed Dowitchers fed most during the midday and late periods and slept most during the early period. Least Sandpipers fed most during the early period, whereas feeding activities of Western Sandpipers remained 70-80{\%} throughout the day. Each of these species use different behavioral strategies in response to such factors as migration distances, energetic needs, differential predation, nocturnal foraging, and diet.

abstract = {Avian long-distance migration involves the storage and expenditure of very large fuel loads. Birds may double in weight before take-off on flights of many 1000 km, and they may lose half their body mass over the subsequent few days that such trips take. Recent studies indicate that in addition to the storage and depletion of fat, the muscles and belly organs also undergo considerable changes in size in the course of such migrations. Such intraindividual and repeatedly reversed changes in stores and organ sizes represent a class of phenotypic plasticity called 'phenotypic flexibility'. Using preliminary comparative data for different populations of Bar-tailed Godwits Limosa lapponica, and several other shorebird species adding variation to the migration strategies sampled (Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria, Ruff Philomachus pugnax, Red Knot Calidris canutus and Bristle-thighed Curlew Numenius tahitiensis), the thesis is developed that the size of the organs carried during take-off represent evolutionary compromises between their functions during the storage, flight and post-arrival phases of migration. In all cases fat-free tissue along with fat is deposited during fuel storage, but the proportions vary a great deal between similarly sized species. Just before departure on long-distance flights, exercise organs (pectoral muscle and heart) tend to show hypertrophy and nutritional organs (stomach, intestine and liver) tend to show atrophy. Reductions in nutritional organs appear most pronounced in (sub-) species that are about to overfly barren oceans with few or no opportunities for emergency landings. Migrant birds seem to show a great deal of adaptive flexibility, and the study of this flexibility may shed light on (presently unknown) physiological mechanisms as well as on correlated ecological constraints on bird migration.},

We previously showed that male and female sandpipers differed in their habitat choice and relative body mass in ways consistent with differential responses to predation danger (Fernandez and Lank in Condor 108:547-557, 2006). Contrary to expectations, however, females were overrepresented in more dangerous habitats. Here, we examine differential usage across habitats and between the sexes of three anti-predator tactics-flock size, density within flocks, and vigilance rate-that may be used cumulatively to reinforce safety, or as trade-offs that compensate for levels of usage of each. We hypothesized, and found, that ordered differences occur among habitats, and that controlling for other factors, females were more cautious than males. For the most part, the use of these three tactics appeared to be cumulative, rather than compensatory. However, with respect to habitat use, birds appeared to compensate for the higher probability of mortality intrinsic to the use of higher-danger habitats by increasing the use of vigilance, foraging in tighter flocks, and maintaining lighter body weights (females only). Thus, both cumulative and compensatory processes operate among anti-predator tactics to determine the net level of safety and trade-off against other factors.},

abstract = {Horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) eggs are a dietary staple of the red knot (Calidris canulus) during its spring stopover on the Delaware Bay. Numbers of knots stopping in Delaware Bay declined in the 1990s concurrent with a decline in horseshoe crabs, leading to the hypothesis that reduced horseshoe crab egg abundance limited the red knot population. Management efforts, including a seasonal harvest moratorium in the Delaware Bay, have been instituted to restore crab populations to levels of sustainable use by multiple users, including migratory birds. Our objective was to evaluate the sufficiency of horseshoe crab eggs in Delaware Bay in May-June 2004 and 2005 for knots to refuel for their migratory flight to the Arctic breeding grounds. We examined egg counts to determine if there were fewer high egg-density sites later than earlier in the day and season, as migrating birds might deplete this resource. We studied foraging rates at red knot locations to determine if foraging probes increased with time of day and season as birds depleted surface eggs by pecking, then began probing for subsurface eggs. Finally, we experimentally tested whether red knots and their competitors depleted horseshoe crab eggs. Crab egg numbers at knot foraging sites did not decline throughout the day or season in 2004. In both years, we found no evidence that knots switched from pecking to probing with increases in time since sunrise or start of the stopover. Egg numbers were similar in exclosed and accessible plots on crab nesting depressions and in areas of open intertidal zone, but were significantly lower in accessible than in exclosed plots in the wrack line. Our results indicate that horseshoe crab eggs in Delaware Bay were sufficient to support the refueling of the present-day stopover population of red knots. If an increase in the availability of crab eggs to foraging birds does not result in an increase in knot numbers, managers must prioritize mitigation of limiting factors at other historically important spring stopovers and on the poorly understood breeding and wintering grounds in addition to the Delaware Bay.

abstract = {AbstractResource managers commonly face the need to evaluate the ecological consequences of specific water diversions of small streams. We addressed this need by conducting 4 years of biophysical monitoring of stream reaches above and below a diversion and applying two individual-based models of salmonid fish that simulated different levels of behavioral complexity. The diversion of interest captured about 24{\%} of streamflow between June and October but had little or no effect over the remainder of the year. The change in biomass of Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and steelhead (anadromous Rainbow Trout) over the dry season (June–October) favored the upstream control over the downstream diversion reach over 4 years (2008–2011). Dry-season growth did not differ consistently between the two reaches but did exhibit substantial annual variation. Longer-term observations revealed that in both reaches most fish growth occurred outside the period of dry-season diversion. After calibration to the upstream contro...},

abstract = {The Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola is one of the most
threatened Western Palearctic passerine species, classified as globally
Vulnerable. With its breeding grounds relatively secure, a clear need
remains for the monitoring and protection of the migration and wintering
grounds of this rare and endangered migrant. Recent research has shown
that the Aquatic Warbler migrates through northwest Africa in autumn and
spring. The wintering grounds are apparently limited to wetlands of
sub-Saharan West Africa, with records from only about 20 localities in
Mauritania, Mali, Senegal and Ghana. Given the lack of knowledge of its
whereabouts, we decided to use the available data to predict the
wintering distribution of the Aquatic Warbler with the help of
Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We used a novel approach to model
the distribution of rarely recorded species, which is based on a
combination of presence-only and presence-absence modelling techniques.
Using the program BIOMOD, we thus generated four progressively more
conservative predictions of where the Aquatic Warbler overwinters in
Africa. Whereas the most permissive model predicts the Aquatic Warbler
to be found in a latitudinal band stretching from the Senegal river
delta all the way to the Red Sea coast, the most restrictive model
suggests a much smaller area concentrated within the regions around the
Senegal river delta in northern Senegal and southern Mauritania and
around the Niger inundation zone in southern Mali and eastern Burkina
Faso. Such model predictions may be useful guidelines to focus further
field research on the Aquatic Warbler. Given the excellent model
predictions in this study, this novel technique may prove useful to
model the distribution of other rare and endangered species, thus
providing a means to guide future survey efforts.},

We tested for the existence of a form of within-observer differences in skill level, namely a change in ability to count birds of a given species after an observer's first year on a given route. An increase in ability could positively bias the trend estimate. Removal of an observer's first year of observation on each route for the period 1966 to 1991 resulted in lower average unweighted trend estimates for 415 of 459 species (90{\%}). These reductions were statistically significant for 213 species (46{\%}). The average reduction in trend was 1.8{\%} change per year (SD = 5.4{\%}). In route-regression analysis, route data are weighted by a measure of precision. Removing first-year observer counts reduced the weighted trend estimate for 275 of 416 species (66{\%}), but differences generally were small.

abstract = {The spoon-billed sandpiper is an endemic of the northern Russian Far East and one of the rarest wader species over the world. During the field survey (the summer of 2002) of the coast of Kolyuchinskaya Bay and in lagoons located to the east, the species breeding population has declined by 3-5 times since the 1970s and amounted to 50 breeding pairs. Reasons for this decline are uncertain. They seem to occur outside the breeding grounds, on staging or wintering areas in South Eastern Asia. The breeding productivity of spoon-billed sandpiper is relatively low, but it did not decrease in the recent decades. The breeding success in 2002 was higher than in the 1980s; however, it was still about half of the minimum level necessary to keep the local breeding population stable. Annual survival of spoon-billed sandpiper is about 5-15{\%} lower than in several other small Calidridinae waders. An increased mortality rather than the decreased productivity appears to be responsible for the general decline of the spoon-billed sandpiper population. In the early 2000s, its total world population was estimated at 350-500 breeding pairs. The estimate of the spoon-billed sandpiper population obtained by Flint and Kondratyev (1977) is likely an overestimate.},

We radio tracked migrants using the Argos satellite system. Our initial samples were 34 Swainson's Hawks from representative areas of their breeding range, and 61 Peregrine Falcons captured at nest sites across the North American boreal forest and low Arctic or on the migration routes along the mid-Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. The average distance of migration for Peregrines was 8,624 km southward, and 8,247 km northward. Peregrines travelled at an average I ate of 172 km/d southward and 198 km/d going north. Peregrine Falcons used at least three broad, general routes south from the breeding areas, and individuals stopped migrating as far north as the U.S.A. mid-Atlantic coast and as far south as central Argentina. The radiomarked Peregrine Falcons used coastal routes, mid-continental routes, and water-crossing routes: the Davis Strait and Caribbean Sea. During northward migration, Peregrines migrating through at Padre Island, Texas diverged for destinations from central Alaska across the continent to central West Greenland. Swainson's Hawks migrated an average of about 13,504 km southward and 11,952 km northward, and travelled 188 km/d southward and 150 km/d northward. Swainson's Hawks converged in eastern Mexico on the Gulf of Mexico Coast. Southward, these hawks followed a narrow, well-defined path through Central America, across the Andes Mountains in Columbia, and east of the Andes to central Argentina where they all spent the austral summer. Swainson's Hawks northward migration largely retraced their southward route.},

Birds migrating or foraging while airborne are thought to spend some time resting on the ground or water to recover from these energetically demanding activities. However, for several decades ornithologists have claimed that some swifts may stay airborne for almost their whole lifetime. Here we present the first unequivocal evidence that an individual bird of the Alpine swift (Tachymarptis melba) can stay airborne for migration, foraging and roosting over a period of more than 6 months. To date, such long-lasting locomotive activities had been reported only for animals living in the sea. Even for an aerodynamically optimized bird, like the Alpine swift, flying requires a considerable amount of energy for continuous locomotive control. Our data imply that all vital physiological processes, including sleep, can be perpetuated during flight.},

abstract = {Bird migration phenology shows strong responses to climate change.
Studies of trends and patterns in phenology are typically based on
annual summarizing metrics, such as means and quantiles calculated from
raw daily count data. However, with irregularly sampled data and large
day-to-day variation, such metrics can be biased and noisy, and may be
analysed using phenological functions fitted to the data. Here we use
count data of migration passage from a Finnish bird observatory to
compare different models for the phenological distributions of spring
migration (27 species) and autumn migration (57 species). We assess
parsimony and goodness-of-fit in a set of models, with phenological
functions of different complexity, optionally with covariates accounting
for day-to-day variability. The covariates describe migration
intensities of related species or relative migration intensities the
previous day (autocovariates). We found that parametric models are often
preferred over the more flexible generalized additive models with
constrained degrees of freedom. Models corresponding to a mixture of two
distinct passing populations were frequently preferred over simpler
ones, but usually no more complex models are needed. Slightly more
complex models were favoured in spring compared to autumn. Related
species' migration activity effectively improves the model by accounting
for the large day-to-day variation. Autocovariates were usually not that
relevant, implying that autocorrelation is generally not a major concern
if phenology is modelled properly. We suggest that parametric models are
relatively good for studying single-population migration phenology, or a
mix of two groups with distinct phenologies, especially if daily
variation in migration intensity can be controlled for. Generalized
additive models may be useful when the migrating population composition
is unknown. Despite these guidelines, choosing an appropriate model
involves case-by-case assessment or the biological relevance and
rationale for modelling phenology.},

abstract = {In this paper we review the existing methods of quantifying avian wingtip shape, and compare their efficiency at detecting morphological adaptations to migration. We use multivariate methods to derive two novel measures of avian wingtip shape, pointedness C-2 and convexity C-3, based on measurements of primary feather lengths. Size-constrained components analysis, a modified form of principal components analysis, is used to ensure that the measures are independent of isometric size, and have a consistent interpretation in terms of the geometric shape of the wingtip. Our measures of pointedness and convexity can be calculated easily for both live birds and museum skins, and can be applied to any ecomorphological or functional analysis of avian wingtip shape. This approach circumvents many of the interpretational problems associated with previous wingtip shape indices that are often based on less accurate wing measurements. To test the suggested interpretations of previously published wingtip shape indices, we use a comparative interspecific analysis to determine the interrelations of our new shape measures with these published indices, and with aerodynamic parameters which have known functional significance. Published indices do not always measure the quantities that they are claimed to do, and are beset with awkward terminological inconsistencies. We assess the efficacy and utility of these wingtip shape measures with regard to predicted and well-known morphological adaptations in the wings for migration. Once phylogenetic bias and extraneous ecological factors are controlled, the majority of published wingtip shape indices are unable to detect morphological differences between migratory and nonmigratory species. Our measures of pointedness and convexity confirm that migrants have wingtips that are relatively more pointed and more convex; they also have wings of relatively larger aspect ratio. The biomechanical implications of these adaptations for different flight behaviours are discussed. An appendix discusses some of the statistical problems involved in the analysis of size and shape, and introduces the size-constrained components analysis (SCCA) method, which is applicable to any study of morphological variation.},

abstract = {I consider how adaptive changes in behaviour with population size affect the stability of the population dynamics. In any given year the behavioural rule of a member of a single-species population is determined by the value of a certain trait. I allow for the possibility that this trait value can change from year to year. The number of descendants left in one year's time by an individual depends on its trait value, the values of other population members and the population size. The population dynamics is modelled as the change in population size from one year to the next. I focus on a population that is at a fixed point of the dynamics and in which members adopt the evolutionarily stable trait value for that equilibrium size. I compare the stability of the population dynamics under the following two assumptions about the dependence of trait values on population size: (i) trait values do not change from that at the equilibrium size, and (ii) trait values change so as to be evolutionarily stable for the current size. In a range of examples, I show that adaptive behaviour tends to destabilise population dynamics in the sense that stability under assumption (ii) implies stability under assumption (i). In other words, the region of parameter space for which there is instability under an adaptive response contains the region of instability under no response. Various equivalent general criteria for this to hold are given.},

abstract = {In a Panamanian pond, male tngara frogs (Physalaemus pustulosus) gather in choruses, giving their "advertisement" call to the females that move among them. If a female chooses to make physical contact with a male, he will clasp her and eventually fertilize her eggs. But in vying for the females, the males whose calls are most attractive may also attract the interest of another creature: the fringe-lipped bat, a frog eater. In the Tngara Frog, the most detailed and informative single study available of frogs and their reproductive behavior, Michael J. Ryan demonstrates the interplay of sexual and natural selection. Using techniques from ethology, behavioral ecology, sensory physiology, physiological ecology, and theoretical population genetics in his research, Ryan shows that large males with low-frequency calls mate most successfully. He examines in detail a number of explanations for the females' preferences, and he considers possible evolutionary forces leading to the males' success. Though certain vocalizations allow males to obtain mates and thus should be favored by sexual selection, this study highlights two important costs of such sexual displays: the frogs expand considerable energy in their mating calls, and they advertise their whereabouts to predators. Ryan considers in detail how predators, especially the frige-lipped bat (Trachops cirrhosus), affect the evolution of the tngara frog's calls},

For Semipalmated Sandpiper, a model containing the effects of Julian day, period (Early: 1995–1997, Middle: 2000–2004, Late: 2004–2008) and habitat type (marsh, beach), as well as all interaction terms for these variables (the “full” model) had the strongest support (i.e. lowest AIC score) compared to six reduced models. Results suggested that mean size-adjusted mass declined significantly across periods (Early {\textgreater} Middle {\textgreater} Late). Also, rate of increase in size-adjusted mass within staging periods was significantly greater during the Early compared to Middle and Late periods. For Least Sandpiper, a reduced model that included Julian day and Period had the strongest support. Size-adjusted mass was significantly lower in the Late compared to Early and Middle periods, which were not different from each other. While in Delaware Bay, Semipalmated Sandpipers feed primarily on horseshoe crab eggs during episodes of rapid mass accumulation, but harvest pressure from 1995–2005 dramatically reduced egg availability. Least Sandpipers appear less dependent on this resource, which may explain differences between the two species regarding changes in energetic condition during staging periods in Delaware Bay. Long-term population trend indices suggest that Semipalmated Sandpiper has declined significantly since the 1980s, especially populations migrating along the Atlantic Coast en route to eastern Canadian breeding areas, which could be related, in part, to changes in food availability in Delaware Bay.},

Most studies of escape and hiding time in refuge focus on a single factor, but prey that ignore other factors may soon be dead. Two hypotheses make different predictions about additivity versus interaction of risk–cost factors. The risk-sensitivity hypothesis predicts that multiple factors have additive effects, but optimality theory suggests that interaction is more common. In the only previous study, flight initiation distance (FID = predator–prey distance when escape begins) was affected interactively by 2 risk factors (predator approach speed and directness) but additively by a risk and an escape cost (approach speed and food presence). I predicted that effects of approach speed and other risk factors interact because differences in risk are likely to increase more rapidly with increase in approach speed than other factors. FID by lizards that I approached increased interactively with approach speed and directness in the Sceloporus virgatus and speed and predator persistence in Sceloporus jarrovii. During indirect approaches, fewer S. virgatus fled, and they ran shorter distances. A review of effects of multiple risks and costs on FID and hiding time revealed far more frequent interactive than additive effects between 2 risk factors, as predicted by optimality theory. Additive and interactive effects were equally common between a risk and a cost factor. Findings for some factors differ between FID and hiding time and in other ways. I propose hypotheses to explain some differences.},

abstract = {We use a game-theoretic framework to investigate the reproductive phenology of female kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka). As in the other semelparous species of Pacific salmon, females construct nests in gravel, spawn with males, bury their fertilized eggs, and defend their nest sites until they die several days later. Later-breeding females may reuse previous nest sites, and their digging behavior is thought to subject previously buried eggs to mortality. Using game-theoretic models, we show that females can reduce this risk by allocating resources to longevity (the period between arrival and death) as opposed to eggs. Waiting before territory settlement is also expected if it allows females to conserve energy and delay senescence. The models demonstrate how these costs and benefits interact to select for a seasonal decline in longevity, a well-known phenomenon in the salmonid literature, and a seasonal decline in wait duration. Both of these predictions were supported in a field study of kokanee. Female state of reproductive maturity was the most important proximate factor causing variation in longevity and wait duration. With more than 30{\%} of territories being reused, dig-up is likely an important selective force in this population.},

abstract = {The effect of human disturbance on migrant birds is a conservation issue of international importance, as is determining if disruption has long-term population effects. Disruptions can occur during migration, wintering, breeding and foraging. Thousands of shorebirds migrate through Delaware Bay (Atlantic Coast of North America) in a four-week period each spring; this is the largest concentration of shorebirds in the continental USA. Ecotourists come to see them, creating the potential for disruption. Data available on shorebird/human interactions at a migratory stopover over a 20-year period were used to describe the interactions of shorebirds and people from 1982-- 2002 and examine trends in human disruptions and shorebird behaviour during this time. The rate of disruptions caused by people increased during the 1980s, declined slightly by the early 1990s, and declined sharply by 2002. The decline in human activity along the beach was directly related to the conservation efforts of the New Jersey Endangered and Nongame Species Program, New Jersey Audubon, and others interested in preserving the shorebirds. In the 1980s, birdwatchers concentrated on the beaches on which it was easy to walk and which had the highest shorebird counts, because there were no restrictions on human behaviour. During this time, the average disturbance duration was over 10min, regardless of the type of intruder, and shorebirds were often disruptedforover40min hr−1.Eventhoughthenumber of disruptions declined over the study period, the percentage of shorebirds that flew away (and did not return within 10min) did not change during the 1980s, and increased in 2002. The average time that shorebirds were disrupted per hour by people declined during this period (mainly because there were fewer people on the beaches). The Endangered andNongame Species Program placed signs on shorebird foraging beaches, restricted access, built viewing platforms to contain ecotourists, and eventually patrolled key beaches and issued summonses for infractions. These activities were so effective that only one bird watcher disturbed the birds in 2002. Education was also vital to encouraging local residents not to walk or fish along these beaches during the spring migratory stopover, and to keep their dogs on a leash. These data support the importance of actions on the part of state agencies and conservation organizations to limit disruptions to foraging shorebirds during critical migratory stopovers, a problem faced by shorebirds in many temperate regions of the world.},

abstract = {As late as the 1940s the Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) was the most abundant sandpiper breeding at Churchill, Manitoba. By the 1960s it had undergone a sharp decline, and by the mid-1990s the local population consisted of 11 pairs in a single colony. Nesting was last documented in 2001. Declines had also become evident at several other breeding sites along the Hudson Bay coast of Manitoba and Ontario, as well as in the number of migrants detected on the Atlantic coast of Canada and the northern United States. Information on the biology of the Churchill population in 1993-2004 largely agreed with that gathered at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba, in the 1980s: reproductive success was good and new birds continued to join the colony; however, the number of breeding attempts by individuals was low and decreasing. As there is no evidence that the decline was related to local factors (e.g., altered habitats, climate change), it is probably attributable to mortality in the nonbreeding season, which leaves fewer birds available to return north. Whether causality can be fully resolved is problematic. Monitoring migrants can reveal population trends and studies on the breeding grounds can help frame hypotheses, but both approaches are time-consuming and provide only partial answers. In such cases, restoration of declining species may be best served by fostering habitat conservation throughout a species' range.},

abstract = {We developed an ELISA to measure heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) in muscles of the western sandpiper (Calidris mauri), a long-distance migrant shorebird. H-FABP accounted for almost 11{\%} of cytosolic protein in the heart. Pectoralis H-FABP levels were highest during migration (10{\%}) and declined to 6{\%} in tropically wintering female sandpipers. Premigratory birds increased body fat, but not pectoralis H-FABP, indicating that endurance flight training may be required to stimulate H-FABP expression. Juveniles making their first migration had lower pectoralis H-FABP than adults, further supporting a role for flight training. Aerobic capacity, measured by citrate synthase activity, and fatty acid oxidation capacity, measured by 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA- dehydrogenase and carnitine palmitoyl transferase activities, did not change during premigration but increased during migration by 6, 12, and 13{\%}, respectively. The greater relative induction of H-FABP (+70{\%}) with migration than of catabolic enzymes suggests that elevated H-FABP is related to the enhancement of uptake of fatty acids from the circulation. Citrate synthase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase were positively correlated within individuals, suggesting coexpression, but enzyme activities were unrelated to H-FABP levels.},

abstract = {Flying birds depend on their feathers to undertake most activities, and maintain them in peak condition through periodic molt and frequent preening. Even small exposures to crude oil reduce the integrity of feathers, and could impair flight performance. We trained wild western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) to perform endurance flights in a wind tunnel, and used magnetic resonance body composition analysis to measure energy expenditure after birds were exposed to weathered MC252 crude oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The cost of transport was 0.26+/-0.04 kJ km-1 in controls, and increased by 22{\%} when the trailing edges of the wing and tail were oiled ({\textless}20{\%} of body surface; considered light oiling). Additional crude oil on breast and back feathers ( approximately 30{\%} total surface; moderate oiling) increased the cost of transport by 45{\%} above controls. Oiling tended to decrease flight control, and only half of moderately oiled birds completed the flight test. We then flew birds at a range of speeds to estimate basic kinematic parameters. At low speeds, light and moderately oiled birds had larger wingbeat amplitudes than controls, while moderately oiled birds showed greater wingbeat frequencies across all speeds, and a shift in optimal flight speed towards higher wind speeds. We suggest these changes reflect poorer lift production and increased drag on the wings and body. Oiling will increase the difficulty and energy costs of locomotion for daily and seasonal activities such as foraging, predator evasion, territory defense, courtship, chick provisioning, commuting and long-distance migration. These sub-lethal effects must be considered in oil spill impact assessments.},

abstract = {It is unquestionably true that hierarchical models represent an order of magnitude increase in the scope and complexity of models for ecological data. The past decade has seen a tremendous expansion of applications of hierarchical models in ecology. The expansion was primarily due to the advent of the Bayesian computational methods. We congratulate the authors for writing a clear summary of hierarchical models in ecology. While we agree that hierarchical models are highly useful to ecology, we have reservations about the Bayesian principles of statistical inference commonly used in the analysis of these models. One of the major reasons why scientists use Bayesian analysis for hierarchical models is the myth that for all practical purposes, the only feasible way to fit hierarchical models is Bayesian. Cressie et al. (2009) do perfunctorily mention the frequentist approaches but are quick to launch into an extensive review of the Bayesian analyses. Frequentist inferences for hierarchical models such as those based on maximum likelihood are beginning to catch up in ease and feasibility (De Valpine 2004, Lele et al. 2007). The recent {\^{a}}data cloning{\^{a}} algorithm, for instance, {\^{a}}tricks{\^{a}} the Bayesian MCMC setup into providing maximum likelihood estimates and their standard errors (Lele et al. 2007). A natural question that a scientist should ask is: if one has a hierarchical model for which full frequentist (say, based on ML estimation) as well as Bayesian inferences are available, which should be used and why? This can only be answered based on the philosophical underpinnings. ... (A)re ecologists making a Faustian bargain? ... Royall (2000) quantifies the concept of weak inference in terms of probability of weak evidence where, based on the observed data, one cannot distinguish between different mechanisms with enough confidence. We surmise that the probability of weak evidence becomes unacceptably large as the number of unobserved states increases. We feel that scientists should be wary of introducing too many hierarchies in the modeling framework.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine whether blood oxygen capacity of waders varies with respect to migration at both inter-specific and individual level. To verify this hypothesis we measured hemoglobin concentration in 875 waders from 14 species during their autumn migration through central Poland. In most of the species we found an increase in the hemoglobin levels along with increasing fat loads during the stopover period, which suggests that individual birds are able to elevate their oxygen-carrying capacity of blood prior to departure on a migratory flight. Positive relationship between hemoglobin concentrations of waders and their fat loads was confirmed at the inter-specific level by the comparative analysis of independent contrasts. Comparative analysis also demonstrated that hemoglobin concentrations were positively related with theoretical flight range and mean refueling rate during stopovers. The results indicate that species traveling according to the strategy of energy-minimization (short-distance migrants, low fat reserves, low refueling rates) have lower blood oxygen capacity in comparison to time-selected species (long-distance migrants, high fat reserves, high refueling rates). It remains uncertain whether high hemoglobin levels in long-distance migrants are a fixed evolutionary trait or a temporal physiological adaptation associated with carrying considerable fat load. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Our analysis identified several novel prey items—arachnids, crabs, bivalves, several terrestrial and freshwater insect species, ctenophores, cnidarians, and fish (likely eggs or juveniles)—indicating that Semipalmated Sandpipers consume prey from marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems. Connections between Semipalmated Sandpipers and freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems were previously unknown in the Bay of Fundy.

abstract = {Estuarine intertidal soft-bottom macrobenthic infauna of the Tagus estuary was characterised using different mesh size sieves and sediment sampling depth. The study sampled 105 sites using a hand held 0.01 m2 corer. The top layer (0–5 cm) was sieved through nested 1.0 and 0.5 mm meshes whereas the bottom layer (5– 20 cm) was through a 1 mm mesh. The total survey took 26 taxa of more than 5800 individuals and a total wet weight biomass of over 650 g. The top layer, using both sieves, gathered 23 taxa (92{\%} of the total), more than 5600 specimens (96{\%}) but less than 8 g of biomass (1{\%}) whereas the 1.0 mm sieve retained 21 taxa (91{\%}), more than 1700 specimens (31{\%}) and almost 7 g of biomass (1{\%}). Abundance was dominated by small annelids, of which Streblospio shrubsolii was 68{\%}, whereas biomass was dominated by molluscs, with the bivalve Scrobicularia plana representing 98{\%}. Multivariate analyses showed an abundance pattern where the top layer data was very similar to that obtained with both layers. The bottom layer data were needed to accurately represent the total biomass pattern. The macro- faunal spatial pattern identified with the 0.5 mm sieve data differed from that identified by the 1.0 mm and was essential to discriminate a faunal assemblage located along the upper part of the shore. It was concluded that in order to charac- terize the macrofauna community structure, based on the presence/absence of taxa, the top layer and a 1.0 mm sieve would be sufficient. An abundance-based characterization requires the top layer and a 0.5 mm sieve whereas a biomass-based characterization requires data for both layers but it is sufficient to use the 1.0 mm sieve},

abstract = {Body condition (i.e. relative mass after correcting for structural size) affects the behaviour of migrating birds, but how body condition affects migratory performance, timing and fitness is still largely unknown. Here, we studied the effects of relative body condition on individual departure decisions, wind selectivity, flight speed and timing of migration for a long-distance migratory shorebird, the red knot Calidris canutus rufa. By using automated VHF telemetry on a continental scale, we studied knots{\&}{\#}039; migratory movements with unprecedented temporal resolution over a 3-year period. Knots with a higher relative body condition left the staging site later than birds in lower condition, yet still arrived earlier to their Arctic breeding grounds compared to knots in lower relative body condition. They accomplished this by selecting more favourable winds at departure, thereby flying faster and making shorter stops en route. Individuals with a higher relative body condition in spring migrated south up to a month later than individuals in lower condition, suggesting that individuals in better condition were more likely to have bred successfully. Moreover, individuals with a lower relative body condition in spring had a lower probability of being detected in autumn, suggestive of increased mortality. The pressure to arrive early to the breeding grounds is considered to be an important constraint of migratory behaviour and this study highlights the important influence of body condition on migratory decisions, performance and potentially fitness of migrant birds.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that birds migrate faster in spring than in autumn because of competition for arrival order at breeding grounds and environmental factors such as increased daylight. Investigating spring and autumn migration performances is important for understanding ecological and evolutionary constraints in the timing and speed of migration. We compiled measurements from tracking studies and found a consistent predominance of cases showing higher speeds and shorter durations during spring compared to autumn, in terms of flight speeds (airspeed, ground speed, daily travel speed), stopover duration, and total speed and duration of migration. Seasonal differences in flight speeds were generally smaller than those in stopover durations and total speed/duration of migration, indicating that rates of foraging and fuel deposition were more important than flight speed in accounting for differences in overall migration performance. Still, the seasonal differences in flight speeds provide important support for time selection in spring migration.},

abstract = {Predators can influence primary producers by generating cascades of effects in ecological webs. These effects are often non-intuitive, going undetected because they involve many links and different types of species interactions. Particularly, little is understood about how antagonistic (negative) and mutualistic (positive) interactions combine to create cascades. Here, we show that black bears can benefit plants by consuming ants. The ants are mutualists of herbivores and protect herbivores from other arthropod predators. We found that plants near bear-damaged ant nests had greater reproduction than those near undamaged nests, due to weaker ant protection for herbivores, which allowed herbivore suppression by arthropod predators. Our results highlight the need to integrate mutualisms into trophic cascade theory, which is based primarily on antagonistic relationships. Predators are often conservation targets, and our results suggest that bears and other predators should be managed with the understanding that they can influence primary producers through many paths.},

Comparisons of sediment characteristics, redox potential and meio- and macrofaunal populations in treatments with enhanced, natural and reduced densities of Corophium revealed effects on sediment physico-chemistry and on small meiofaunal-sized species, but these were weak and not always consistent. High densities of adult Corophium consistently depressed the abundance of smaller conspecifics although the mechanism of this interaction has not been identified. The results are discussed in the context of the ability of Corophium to promote the recovery of organically enriched sediments.},

abstract = {Escaping from a predator is a matter of life or death, and prey are expected to adaptively alter their physiology under chronic predation risk in ways that may affect escape. Theoretical models assume that escape performance is mass-dependent whereby scared prey strategically maintain an optimal body mass to enhance escape. Experiments testing the mass-dependent predation risk (MDPR) hypothesis have demonstrated that prior experience of predation risk can affect body mass, and the behavioural decisions about evasive actions to take. Other studies on natural changes in body mass indicate that mass can affect escape. No single experiment has tested if all of these components are indeed linked, which is a critical necessary condition underpinning the MDPR. 2.We tested all components of the MDPR in a repeated-measures experiment by presenting predator and non-predator cues to brown-headed cowbirds housed in semi-natural conditions. Exposure to predator cues affected body mass, fat, pectoral muscle thickness, and evasive actions (take-off angle and speed), but not the physiological capacity to escape, as measured by flying ability. Examining individual variation revealed that flying ability was unrelated to mass loss in either sex, unrelated to mass gain in males, and only females that gained a very large amount of mass flew poorly. 3.We next conducted a body mass manipulation in the lab to rigorously test whether small to large perturbations in mass can ever affect flying ability. We induced either no change in mass (control), a moderate reduction of {\textless}10{\%}, and a more extreme reduction of {\textgreater}10{\%} which the literature suggests should enhance flight. Flying ability was maintained regardless of treatment. Examining individual variation revealed the same precise patterns as in the first experiment. 4.We conclude that prey may alter their mass and evasive actions in response to predation risk, but their escape ability remains robust and inelastic, presumably because dis-abling oneself is likely to lead to disastrous consequences. We suggest that animals may only face a mass-dependant predation risk trade-off in a narrow set of circumstances linked to life history stages that require large amounts of mass gain, e.g. parturition and migration.},

abstract = {1. Behaviour-based models of animal population dynamics provide ecologists with a powerful tool for predicting the response of such populations to both natural and human-induced environmental changes.2. We developed this approach by addressing two outstanding issues in the application of such models: the need to adopt a large-scale spatially explicit approach, and the need to consider the year-round dynamics of animal populations.3. Spatially explicit, year-round, behaviour-based models of two populations of arctic-breeding geese, the Svalbard population of the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis and the dark-bellied race of the brent goose Branta bernicla, were developed. Both populations have been the subject of serious conservation concern and are currently a source of increasing conflict with agricultural interests.4. There was generally good agreement between empirically derived and model-generated density-dependent functions, and of seasonal patterns of the distribution and movement of populations within and between sites, and of energy reserve levels within a population.5. Sensitivity analyses, however, highlighted the importance of accurate parameter estimation with respect to the predictions of such models, and the potential flaws in the predictions of existing models that have not adopted a spatially explicit approach when dealing with wide-ranging migratory populations.6. The effect of the removal of a given area of habitat on both populations was predicted to vary depending upon the spatial configuration of the change. This further emphasizes the need for a spatially explicit approach.7. Both barnacle goose and brent goose populations were predicted to decline following habitat loss in their winter or spring-staging sites. Simulations suggested that barnacle geese might be less vulnerable to winter habitat loss than brent geese. This reflected the relative strengths of the density-dependence of productivity and winter mortality in the two models and provided a clear illustration of the need for a year-round approach to animal population dynamics.8. We believe that these models, and this approach to understanding the population dynamics of long-distance migrants, will be beneficial in attempting to answer the increasingly urgent and frequent requests to predict the response of such populations to environmental change.},

The deepest-ever dive profile recorded for a reptile was obtained in the oceanic Atlantic, with a 54-min dive to 626 m on 26 August 2002.

abstract = {Protandry, the earlier arrival of males than of females on breeding areas, occurs in many taxa, including many migratory birds. Numerous hypotheses have been generated to explain protandry. Using bird-banding records, I show that protogyny, the earlier migration of females, frequently occurs in the autumn, though it is less universal and less dramatic than spring protandry. In one species, it occurs in both hatch-year and adult birds. When (1) spring and autumn, (2) departures and arrivals, and (3) breeding and wintering ground conditions are considered, hypotheses generated only to explain spring protandry can be more thoroughly evaluated. Using that approach, the most parsimonious explanation of differential migration between the sexes explains earlier male arrival in spring and later male departure in autumn through either (1) indirect selection operating on intrasexual male competition for territories or (2) direct selection operating on intersexual relations requiring males to be present on breeding territories when females are present. In autumn-protogynous species, males may "play chicken," balancing the benefits of remaining longer than females and protecting territories for subsequent years against the costs of remaining in the north under deteriorating conditions and delaying the acquisition of a good winter territory.},

abstract = {Conserving migratory species requires protecting connected habitat along the pathways they travel. Despite recent improvements in tracking animal movements, migratory connectivity remains poorly resolved at a population level for the vast majority of species, hampering conservation prioritisation. In the face of these data limitations, we develop a novel approach to spatial prioritisation based on a model of potential connectivity, derived from empirical data on species abundance and distances travelled between sites while on migration. Applying this approach to migratory shorebirds using the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, we demonstrate that conservation strategies that prioritise sites based on connectivity and abundance together, outperform strategies that only prioritise sites based on the abundance of birds. The conservation value of a site is therefore dependent on both its capacity to support migratory animals and its position within the migratory pathway, with the loss of crucial sites leading to partial or total population collapse. We suggest that strategies prioritising conservation action at sites supporting large populations of migrants should, where possible, be augmented using data or models on the spatial arrangement of sites.

abstract = {Habitat-selection theory can be applied to solve numerous problems in the conservation and management of wildlife. Many of the solutions involve the use of habitat isodars, graphs of densities in pairs of habitats such that expected fitness is the same in both. For single species, isodars reflect differences in habitat quality, and specify the conditions when population density will, or will not, match the abundance of resources. When two or more species co-occur, isodars can be used to assess not only whether the species compete with one another, but also differences in habitat, in habitat selection, and in the functional form of density-dependent competition. Isodars have been applied to measure scales of habitat selection, the presence or absence of edge effects, as well as the number of habitats that species recognise in heterogeneous landscapes. Merged with foraging behaviour, isodars reveal the relative roles of habitat selection, spatial structure, and environmental stochasticity on local populations. Habitat-selection models can be linked similarly with theories of patch use to assess the underlying cause of source–sink dynamics. Isodars can detect and measure Allee effects, describe human habitat selection, and use human occupation of habitat as a leading indicator of threatened biodiversity. Even so, we have only begun to reveal the potential of habitat selection, and other optimal behaviours, to solve pressing problems in conservation and management.},

abstract = {Only recently has the influence of landscape structure on habitat use been a research focus in wetland systems. During non-breeding periods when food can be locally limited, wetland spatial pattern across a landscape may be of great importance in determining wetland use. We studied the influence of landscape structure on abundances of wintering Dunlin (Calidris alpina) and Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus) observed on wetlands in the agricultural Willamette Valley of Oregon, USA, during two winters (1999-2000, 2000-2001) of differing rainfall. We examined (1) shorebird use within a sample of 100 km2 regions differing in landscape structure (hectares of shorebird habitat [wet, unvegetated]) and (2) use of sites differing in landscape context (area of shorebird habitat within a species-defined radius). For use of sites, we also assessed the influence of two local characteristics: percent of soil exposed and area of wet habitat. We analyzed data using linear regression and information-theoretic modeling. During the dry winter (2000-2001), Dunlin were attracted to regions with more wetland habitat and their abundances at sites increased with greater area of shorebird habitat within both the site and the surrounding landscape. In contrast, Dunlin abundances at sites were related to availability of habitat at only a local scale during the wet winter (1999-2000). Regional habitat availability was of little importance in predicting Killdeer distributions, and Killdeer site use appeared unrelated to habitat distributions at both landscape and local scales. Results suggest prioritizing sites for conservation that are located in areas with high wetland coverage},

abstract = {Generic early-warning signals such as increased autocorrelation and variance have been demonstrated in time-series of systems with alternative stable states approaching a critical transition. However, lag times for the detection of such leading indicators are typically long. Here, we show that increased spatial correlation may serve as a more powerful early-warning signal in systems consisting of many coupled units. We first show why from the universal phenomenon of critical slowing down, spatial correlation should be expected to increase in the vicinity of bifurcations. Subsequently, we explore the applicability of this idea in spatially explicit ecosystem models that can have alternative attractors. The analysis reveals that as a control parameter slowly pushes the system towards the threshold, spatial correlation between neighboring cells tends to increase well before the transition. We show that such increase in spatial correlation represents a better early-warning signal than indicators derived from time-series provided that there is sufficient spatial heterogeneity and connectivity in the system.},

* 1How climatic changes affect migratory birds remains difficult to predict because birds use multiple sites in a highly interdependent manner. A better understanding of how conditions along the flyway affect migration and ultimately fitness is of paramount interest.
* 2Therefore, we developed a stochastic dynamic model to generate spatially and temporally explicit predictions of stop-over site use. For each site, we varied energy expenditure, onset of spring, intake rate and day-to-day stochasticity independently. We parameterized the model for the migration of pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus from its wintering grounds in Western Europe to its breeding grounds on Arctic Svalbard.
* 3Model results suggested that the birds follow a risk-averse strategy by avoiding sites with comparatively high energy expenditure or stochasticity levels in favour of sites with highly predictable food supply and low expenditure. Furthermore, the onset of spring on the stop-over sites had the most pronounced effect on staging times while intake rates had surprisingly little effect.
* 4Subsequently, using empirical data, we tested whether observed changes in the onset of spring along the flyway explain the observed changes in migration schedules of pink-footed geese from 1990 to 2004. Model predictions generally agreed well with empirically observed migration patterns, with geese leaving the wintering grounds earlier while considerably extending their staging times in Norway.},

abstract = {Neotropical migratory birds are declining across the Western Hemisphere, but conservation efforts have been hampered by the inability to assess where migrants are most limited - the breeding grounds, migratory stopover sites, or wintering areas. A major challenge has been the lack of an efficient, reliable, and broadly applicable method for measuring the strength of migratory connections between populations across the annual cycle. Here we show how high-resolution genetic markers can be used to identify genetically distinct groups of a migratory bird, the Wilson's warbler (Cardellina pusilla), at fine enough spatial scales to facilitate assessing regional drivers of demographic trends. By screening 1626 samples using 96 highly divergent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from a large pool of candidates ({\~{}}450,000), we identify novel region-specific migratory routes and timetables of migration along the Pacific Flyway. Our results illustrate that high-resolution genetic markers are more reliable, precise, and amenable to high throughput screening than previously described intrinsic marking techniques, making them broadly applicable to large-scale monitoring and conservation of migratory organisms.

abstract = {Evolutionary radiations of colonists on archipelagos provide valuable insight into mechanisms and modes of speciation. The apparent diversification of Galapagos mockingbirds (Nesomimus) provoked Darwin's initial conception of adaptive radiation, but the monophyly of this historically important exemplar has not been evaluated with molecular data. Additionally, as with most Galapagos organisms, we have a poor understanding of the temporal pattern of diversification of the mockingbirds following colonization(s) from source populations. Here we present a molecular phylogeny of Galapagos and other mockingbird populations based on mitochondrial sequence data. Monophyly of Galapagos mockingbirds was supported, suggesting a single colonization of the archipelago followed by diversification. Our analyses also indicate that Nesominius is nested within the traditional genus Mimus, making the latter paraphyletic, and that the closest living relatives of Galapagos mockingbirds appear to be those currently found in North America, northern South America, and the Caribbean, rather than the geographically nearest species in continental Ecuador. Thus, propensity for over-water dispersal may have played a more important role than geographic proximity in the colonization of Galapagos by mockingbirds. Within Galapagos, four distinct mitochondrial DNA clades were identified. These four clades differ from current taxonomy in several important respects. In particular, mockingbirds in the eastern islands of the archipelago (Espanola, San Cristobal, and Genovesa) have very similar mitochondrial DNA sequences, despite belonging to three different nominal species, and mockingbirds from Isabela, in the west of the archipelago, are more phylogenetically divergent than previously recognized. Consistent with current taxonomy is the phylogenetic distinctiveness of the Floreana mockingbird (N. trifosciatus) and close relationships among most mockingbirds from the central and northern region of the archipelago (currently considered conspecific populations of N. parvulus). Overall, phylogeographic patterns are consistent with a model of wind-based dispersal within Galapagos, with colonization of more northerly islands by birds from more southern populations, but not the reverse. Further radiation in Galapagos would require coexistence of multiple species on individual islands, but this may be prevented by relatively limited morphological divergence among mockingbirds and by lack of sufficient habitat diversity in the archipelago to support more than one omnivorous mimid.},

Here we document the decline of their food stocks in this area, based on a yearly large-scale benthic mapping effort, from 1996 to 2005. For each benthic sampling position, intake rate (mg/s, ash-free dry mass) was predicted by an optimal diet model based on digestive rate maximization. Over the ten years, when accounting for a threshold value to meet energetic fuelling demands, subspecies canutus lost 86{\%} of its suitable foraging area. Over this period, the proportion of probable canutus in mist-net catches in July-August declined relative to overwintering islandica Knots. This suggests that canutus dropped even more in numbers than islandica, for which we showed earlier a food-explained decline in numbers. We discuss the possible causality between a decline in the quality of intertidal mudflats in the Dutch Wadden Sea and population declines of Knots in the West-African wintering quarters.},

We used giving-up density (GUD: food remaining in patches following a day of foraging) as a surrogate for quitting harvest rate.

GUDs were higher in the open than in the bush microhabitat. Augmenting food to either the bush or open microhabitats increased GUDs in both microhabitats. Augmenting food caused the difference in GUDs between the bush and the open microhabitats to increase.},

abstract = {During spring raptor migration, resident, group-living, Arabian Babblers Turdoides squamiceps in Israel are exposed to many avian predators that differ in the level of predation threat that they pose. Accurate information about immediate safety while foraging may be provided by the sentinel, a high-perched non-foraging Babbler that actively scans and warns for predators. We tested whether, at this migratory hotspot, the bewildering number and diversity of potential avian predators (perhaps more than anywhere else in the world) may be more than a reliable sentinel could handle. We monitored ten Babbler groups regularly for a number of hours per day throughout the migration season, and scored whether the Babblers gave alarm calls when different bird species were in sight. Analyses showed that Babblers are very skilled in distinguishing between species of high and low predation threat (interspecific threat-sensitivity). In addition, Babblers distinguished accurately between encounters with dangerous vs. harmless individuals from predator species of potentially high predation threat (intraspecific threat-sensitivity). Overall, Babblers cautiously overestimated predation threat, probably because errors involving alarms for harmless predators have a lower fitness cost than errors involving attacks by dangerous predators that are ignored. However, fewer warnings were given for the more common predators of lower threat, which suggests that Babblers initially overestimated the risk of predation, but subsequently learned to assess the level of threat more accurately as soon as more information was available. Overall, our findings agree closely with theoretical predictions regarding adaptive and sophisticated anti-predation behaviour in a variable world.},

Two methods are currently used to experimentally examine combined predation by multiple predator species: the additive and substitutive experimental designs. I simultaneously employed both experimental designs to examine predation by two crab species on shared mussel prey. I show that the two methods yield results that disagree both quantitatively and qualitatively, leading to very different conclusions about the way that predator species combine to affect prey mortality. This discrepancy occurred because the two methods examine complimentary, but not interchangeable questions.

abstract = {Migrating birds must accumulate fuel during their journeys and this fuel load should incur an increased risk of predation. Migratory fuelling should increase individual mass-dependent predation risk for two reasons. First, acquisition costs are connected to the increased time a bird must spend foraging to accumulate the fuel loads and the reduced predator detection that accompanies foraging. Second, birds with large fuel loads have been shown to suffer from impaired predator evasion which makes them more vulnerable when actually attacked. Here, I investigate the relative importance of these two aspects of mass-dependent predation risk and I have used published data and a hypothetical situation for a foraging bird to investigate how much migratory fuelling in terms of escape performance and natural variation in predator detection contribute to individual risk during foraging. Results suggest that for birds foraging close to protective cover the negative impact of fuel load on flight performance is very small, whereas variation in time to predator detection is of great importance for a bird's survival. However, the importance of flight performance for predation risk increases as the distance to cover increases. Hence, variation in predator detection (and vigilance) probably influences individual survival much more than migratory fuel load and consequently, to understand risk management during migration studies that focus on vigilance and predator detection during fuelling are much needed. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Negative density-dependence is generally studied within a single trophic level, thereby neglecting its effect on higher trophic levels. The 'functional response' couples a predator's intake rate to prey density. Most widespread is a type II functional response, where intake rate increases asymptotically with prey density; this predicts the highest predator densities at the highest prey densities. In one of the most stringent tests of this generality to date, we measured density and quality of bivalve prey (edible cocklesCerastoderma edule) across 50 km² of mudflat, and simultaneously, with a novel time-of-arrival methodology, tracked their avian predators (red knotsCalidris canutus). Because of negative density-dependence in the individual quality of cockles, the predicted energy intake rates of red knots declined at high prey densities (a type IV, rather than a type II functional response). Resource-selection modelling revealed that red knots indeed selected areas of intermediate cockle densities where energy intake rates were maximized given their phenotype-specific digestive constraints (as indicated by gizzard mass). Because negative density-dependence is common, we question the current consensus and suggest that predators commonly maximize their energy intake rates at intermediate prey densities. Prey density alone may thus poorly predict intake rates, carrying capacity and spatial distributions of predators.},

abstract = {This paper explores the extent to which life histories of infaunal prey have been molded and maintained by predation. It is argued such relationships should be most evident for episodic predation, where the predation is predictable, intense and short-lived. Migratory shorebirds are used herein as model episodic predators. Four stop-over areas in North America, for which experimental data exist, are compared. Evidence exists that Semipalmated Sandpipers in the upper Bay of Fundy maintain the observed life history of their major prey, the amphipod Corophium volutator. In southeastern Massachusetts, shorebirds significantly reduce the abundance of their prey but in a frequency-dependent fashion, precluding life history responses of the prey. For Grays Harbor, Washington and Delaware Bay, there is no detectable effect of shorebird predation on the infauna. In three of the four studies, there is no apparent effect of early shorebird migrants in significantly increasing the required stop-over of later migrants by depression of prey densities. The data support the characterization of soft-sediment communities as loosely organized assemblages whose specific constitution is determined more by ecological combining ability than by specific evolutionary responses to associated species.},

Length of stay of color-marked individuals was used to estimate fat levels at departure based on a relationship established at the study site between length of stay and the increase in estimated levels of body fat. Our results support the hypothesis that fat levels at migratory departure are related to the annual return rate and also to annual survival. Individuals remaining long enough to accumulate excess body fat (i.e. the low-risk group) were nearly twice as likely to return as were those below theoretically sufficient fat levels (the high-risk group). Fat levels attained at departure may be an important factor in surviving a long migration flight. However, the fact that some individuals in the high-risk group returned (approximately 25{\%} of individuals in two years) indicates that flight-range formulas may underestimate flight capabilities. In the first year of the study 45{\%}, and in the second year 32{\%}, of individuals remained longer than necessary to accumulate theoretically sufficient fat levels, suggesting that some individuals were not operating on a time-selected migration schedule. Disturbance of shorebirds at staging areas may increase the mortality of these birds.},

abstract = {The use of counts of unmarked migrating animals to monitor long term population trends assumes independence of daily counts and a constant rate of detection. However, migratory stopovers often last days or weeks, violating the assumption of count independence. Further, a systematic change in stopover duration will result in a change in the probability of detecting individuals once, but also in the probability of detecting individuals on more than one sampling occasion. We tested how variation in stopover duration influenced accuracy and precision of population trends by simulating migration count data with known constant rate of population change and by allowing daily probability of survival (an index of stopover duration) to remain constant, or to vary randomly, cyclically, or increase linearly over time by various levels. Using simulated datasets with a systematic increase in stopover duration, we also tested whether any resulting bias in population trend could be reduced by modeling the underlying source of variation in detection, or by subsampling data to every three or five days to reduce the incidence of recounting. Mean bias in population trend did not differ significantly from zero when stopover duration remained constant or varied randomly over time, but bias and the detection of false trends increased significantly with a systematic increase in stopover duration. Importantly, an increase in stopover duration over time resulted in a compounding effect on counts due to the increased probability of detection and of recounting on subsequent sampling occasions. Under this scenario, bias in population trend could not be modeled using a covariate for stopover duration alone. Rather, to improve inference drawn about long term population change using counts of unmarked migrants, analyses must include a covariate for stopover duration, as well as incorporate sampling modifications (e.g., subsampling) to reduce the probability that individuals will be detected on more than one occasion.},

abstract = {Much of spatial ecology since the late 1960s has been dominated by two theories, the dynamic theory of island biogeography and the classical metapopulation theory. The latter theory largely replaced the former one in the 1980s, especially in conservation applications. It is only recently that ecologists have fully realized that a relatively simple general theory can be readily constructed that makes some of the simplifying assumptions of the two earlier theories unnecessary. The spatially realistic metapopulation theory thereby provides a more unified framework for spatial ecology than the island theory or the classical metapopulation theory. This article describes the application of the spatially realistic metapopulation theory to real metapopulations living in highly fragmented landscapes. I discuss the principal messages for population ecology and conservation biology, and I also place this theory into a broader context of other approaches to spatial ecology.},

abstract = {The long-distance migrant red knot (Calidris canutus ssp. rufa – Scolopacidae) alternates between the northern and southern ends of the NewWorld, one of the longest yearly migrations of any bird and paradoxically overflying apparently suitable habitat at lower latitudes.This subspecies is sharply declining, with a major mortality event following 2000, attributed to commercial overharvesting of food resources at its Delaware Bay (USA) stop-over site. A full understanding of this peculiar migrant requires an assessment of the foraging conditions at its southern hemisphere wintering sites. Here, for a major wintering site in Argentinean Tierra del Fuego (R{\'{i}}o Grande), we describe and compare food abundance, diet and intake rates during January–February in 1995, 2000 and 2008. The two main prey types were the burrowing clam Darina solenoides and three species of epibenthic mussels Mytilidae. In the year 2000, food availability and intake rate were higher than those recorded at other sites used by knots anywhere else in the world, contributing to the explanation of why red knots carry out this impressive migration. Intake rate in 2008 on the two main prey types was dramatically reduced as a result of birds eating smaller prey and strongly increased human disturbance; the same year we also found a high prevalence of a digenean parasite in Darina. We suggest that during the strongly enhanced winter mortality in 2000, knots did not yet face ecological problems in their southernmost wintering area, consistent with the previous evidence that problems at northern stop-overs negatively affected their numbers. However, in 2008 the ecological conditions at R{\'{i}}o Grande were such that they would have facilitated a further decline, emphasizing the importance of a hemispheric approach to research and management.},

abstract = {Although concerns about harvesting levels of the American Horseshoe Crab, Limulus polyphemus have prompted increased research into its ecology, current understanding of the species' foraging ecology is mostly limited to mid-Atlantic populations. This study elucidates the spatial and temporal pattern of Limulus foraging on an intertidal mudflat of a northern New England estuary. A novel survey method was used to monitor Limulus foraging activity without disturbing the sediment. A fixed 50 mx2 m transect was monitored with monthly surveys of the number of Limulus feeding pits from June to October 2009, May and June 2010. Snorkelling surveys were also carried out to observe individual behavior and examine the spatial scale of activity of individual animals. Results showed frequent and intensive use of the mudflat by foraging Limulus. Limulus were actively foraging within the survey area during all months surveyed. Foraging patterns exhibited a seasonal pattern with activity levels peaking in August 2009 and increased significantly towards the end of the study in June 2010. It was also shown that Limulus intertidal foraging persisted and peaked after the spring breeding season. Observations of foraging Limulus revealed that individual predators dig multiple pits within a single high tide, with little disturbance to the sediment in between. In addition to altering the perception of Limulus as a subtidal predator outside of the breeding season, findings from this study suggests a segregation of spawning and feeding habitats, thus underscoring the need to consider a wider range of critical habitats in the management of Limulus populations [Current Zoology 56 (5): 611-617, 2010].},

abstract = {To save energy and time, migratory birds are expected to select time periods and flight altitudes with favorable wind conditions. In spring 2006, we studied diurnal migration using tracking radar at the Strait of Messina. A total of 1530 radar tracks were analyzed with respect to flight altitude and wind conditions. The tracks included Honey Buzzards, Marsh, Montagu's, and Pallid Harriers, Black Kites, falcons, swallows, swifts, and herons. Maximum flight altitude recorded was 2495 m above ground level (agl), but 90{\%} of birds were flying below 1135 m. All species investigated showed clear evidence that tailwind assistance at the bird's flight altitude was better than below and similar or better than just above. However, the birds did not select the best flight altitude with respect to tailwind assistance within a given height range of 1000 or 2500 m agl. More likely, they were selective for the first optimum they encountered when climbing, even when better winds occurred at higher altitudes. Understanding the selection of flight altitudes by diurnal migrants is essential for modeling and predicting the temporal and spatial concentration of migratory birds. This kind of information is urgently needed for the evaluation of collision risks in relation to the impact of wind turbines on birds but also for assessing aircraft safety.},

As case studies of the effect of climate change on bird migration, I analyzed two long-term data sets of arrival times for eight species of northern breeding migratory wood warblers (Parulidae) gathered over a 100 year period in east-central Illinois (IL, USA) and a 40 year period in western Minnesota (MN, USA). Six (IL) and seven (MN) of the wood warbler species showed no significant tendency to migrate earlier in response to earlier springs in their breeding range. These results suggest that climate change may force many species of long-distance migratory songbirds to become uncoupled in the spring from their food resources that are driven by temperature.},

abstract = {Ecosystem dynamics can exhibit large, nonlinear changes after small changes in an environmental parameter that passes a critical threshold. These regime shifts are often associated with loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Because critical thresholds for regime shifts are hard to determine with precision, some recent studies have focused on deriving signals from dynamics leading up to the thresholds. Models in these studies depend on using noise terms independent of system parameters and variables to add stochasticity. However, demographic stochasticity, an important source of random variability, arises directly from system dynamics. In this study, a framework is developed for modeling demographic stochasticity in a mechanistic way, incorporating system variables and parameters. This framework is applied to a deterministic, dynamic model of a coral reef benthos. The resulting stochastic model indicates that increasing variance—but not skewness—is consistently found in system dynamics approaching a critical threshold of grazing pressure. Even if the threshold is breached, attraction of transient dynamics by a saddle point provides an opportunity for regime shift reversal by management intervention. These results suggest that early warning signals of regime shifts can arise intrinsically in endogenous dynamics and can be detected without reliance on random environmental forcings.},

Our results indicate that predation risk may have profound effects on the structure of ecosystems and is an important constituent of native biodiversity. Our conclusions are based on theory involving trophic cascades, predation risk, and optimal foraging; on the research literature; and on our own recent studies in Yellowstone National Park. Additional research is needed to understand how the lethal effects of predation interact with its nonlethal effects to structure ecosystems.},

abstract = {Book Overview: Despite the wealth of natural historical research conducted on migration over decades, there is still a dearth of hypothesis-driven studies that fully integrate theory and empirical analyses to understand the causes and consequences of migration, and a taxonomic bias towards birds in much migration research. This book takes a comparative, integrated view of animal migration, linking evolution with ecology and management, theory with empirical research, and embracing all the major migratory taxa (including human pastoralists). The scope extends beyond the target organism to consider the ecosystem-level dynamics of migration. The emphasis is on exciting new research avenues that are now opening up, whether due to advances in our understanding of migration as a biological phenomenon or through the availability of a range of new technologies. Broad themes that emerge include integrating migration into the broad spectrum of movement behavior, the need for a comparative and cross-taxonomic approach that considers migration at a range of temporal and spatial scales, and examination of the key roles of resource uncertainty and spatial heterogeneity in driving migratory behavior. The book identifies the potential for new tools to revolutionize the study of migration, including satellite-tracking technology, genomics, and modeling - all of which are linked to increasing computing power. We are now on the verge of a breakthrough in migration research, which is crucial given the multiple threats that face the conservation of migration as a phenomenon, including climate change.},

abstract = {1. Animals should choose the feeding habitat that allows them to meet their energy requirements while minimizing predation risk, but as weather becomes more severe, animals may choose riskier, but more profitable, feeding habitats. 2. At the Tyninghame estuary, Scotland, Redshanks (Tringa totanus) chose to feed on either a mudflat or saltmarsh. Energy intake rates were 23{\%} higher and thermoregulatory costs were 40{\%} lower on the saltmarsh, but predation risk from sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) was 21 times higher. 3. The investigation tested whether the riskier habitat was chosen only when weather conditions were such that individuals were unable to meet their energy requirements in the safer habitat, and how any additional effects of weather affected this choice. 4. When starvation risk increased on the mudflat, more Redshanks selected the saltmarsh where energy budgets alone accounted for 22{\%} of the variation in habitat choice. Temperature and wind may have had smaller additional, independent effects that were probably related to their effects on vigilance behaviour and predator detection. 5. The results show that weather may be crucial in determining habitat choice through its direct effects on starvation and predation risk, and the importance of considering a wide range of weather conditions when determining habitat requirements.},

abstract = {We analyzed differences in wing morphology between sexes and among age classes of Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) to assess possible relationships with differential migration, acrobatic aerial displays, and potential vulnerability to predation, using size-constrained component analysis. Data on wing morphology of all four sex and age classes were available from birds spending the nonbreeding season in northwestern Mexico, and data on females were available from throughout the annual cycle. During the nonbreeding season, females had longer and more pointed wings than males. Within, each sex, adults had longer and more pointed wings than immature birds. Throughout the annual cycle, adult females tended to have longer and more pointed wings than immature females. The longer and more pointed wings of females are consistent with selection on flight efficiency for longer migration distances. The shorter and rounder wings of males are consistent with stronger selection for agility in flight during acrobatic aerial displays, but also with weaker selection for flight efficiency because of shorter migration distances. The rounder wings of immature birds are most consistent with stronger selection for take-off performance as an antipredator adaptation, at a cost of lower flight efficiency during long-distance migratory flight. Considering intraspecific sex and age class differences in wing morphology of species with differential migration complements interspecific comparisons assessing the relative importance of selective agents acting on this character.

abstract = {The migration route of Red-necked Phalarope popula- tions breeding on North Atlantic islands has been sub- ject to considerable speculation. Geolocator tags were fitted to nine Red-necked Phalaropes breeding in north- ern Scotland to assess whether they migrated to Palae- arctic or Nearctic wintering grounds. Of four birds known to return, two had retained their tags, of which one was recaptured. This male Phalarope left Shetland on 1 August 2012 and crossed the Atlantic Ocean to the Labrador Sea off eastern Canada in 6 days, then moved south to reach Florida during September, crossed the Gulf of Mexico into the Pacific Ocean and reached an area between the Galapagos Islands and the South American coast by mid-October, where it remained until the end of April, returning by a similar route until the tag battery failed as the bird was crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The total migration of 22 000 km is approximately 60{\%} longer than the previously assumed route to the western part of the Arabian Sea, and this first evidence of migration of a European breeding bird to the Pacific Ocean also helps to indicate the possible migratory route of the large autumn movements of Red-necked Phalaropes down the east coast of North America.},

abstract = {We model the yearly cycle of small migratory birds to explain the variation in scheduling of complete molt, in particular why some birds molt immediately after breeding on the breeding grounds (summer molt) whereas others migrate to their wintering grounds before molt is initiated (winter molt). We employ the method of dynamic programming, because of its suitability for modelling life history traits. Feather quality and latitude entered the model as state variables and were assumed to affect survival rate and reproductive success. Migration and molt were assumed to be associated with increased mortality risks. By changing the parameters in the model we were able to generate most existing molt patterns, including summer and winter molt, biannual (summer and winter) molt, and molt migration. Our model suggests that the scheduling of molt is basically a result of a trade-off between having a high feather quality during breeding versus during the non-breeding period. A high impact of feather quality on survival rate in combination with low costs of molt resulted in biannual molt. Winter molt became more likely as the survival rate perse increased. A low seasonal amplitude in survival rate is a prerequisite for the occurrence of molt migration. Molt duration, migration costs and reproductive success perse were found to have no impact on the timing of molt. We also investigated the effect of benefits from prior occupancy at breeding and winter grounds.},

abstract = {Long-distance migratory birds are often considered extreme athletes, possessing a range of traits that approach the physiological limits of vertebrate design. In addition, their movements must be carefully timed to ensure that they obtain resources of sufficient quantity and quality to satisfy their high-energy needs. Migratory birds may therefore be particularly vulnerable to global change processes that are projected to alter the quality and quantity of resource availability. Because long-distance flight requires high and sustained aerobic capacity, even minor decreases in vitality can have large negative consequences for migrants. In the light of this, we assess how current global change processes may affect the ability of birds to meet the physiological demands of migration, and suggest areas where avian physiologists may help to identify potential hazards. Predicting the consequences of global change scenarios on migrant species requires (i) reconciliation of empirical and theoretical studies of avian flight physiology; (ii) an understanding of the effects of food quality, toxicants and disease on migrant performance; and (iii) mechanistic models that integrate abiotic and biotic factors to predict migratory behaviour. Critically, a multi-dimensional concept of vitality would greatly facilitate evaluation of the impact of various global change processes on the population dynamics of migratory birds.},

abstract = {Common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) is an important pest fish species in Australasia and North America. Carp are widely implicated in freshwater aquatic resource degradation and both the resource management and broader communities are currently seeking effective control measures. We developed CARPSIM, a simple age-based model to simulate the effects of a range of management scenarios. The model simulates change in population biomass by age and sex-specific growth and simulates change in population abundance through recruitment and sex-specific mortality. Using empirical stock-recruitment data and stochastic components derived from local hydrological data or the southern oscillation index the model simulated the population dynamics of carp populations over 200 years using biological parameters previously estimated for two Victorian populations within the Murray-Darling basin. Carp management scenarios simulated included the effects of fishing the spawning stock; of fishing the whole stock; of spawning or reruitment sabotage; and of driving the population sex ratio towards male dominance. Model predictions suggests that faster growing, shorter-lived populations may be better controlled by molecular methods inducing male-dominance, or spawning sabotage type methods whereas slower growing, long-lived populations may respond best to removal type approaches. Unselective removal, such as poisoning or trapping all age-classes is more likely to cause pseudo-extinction at levels of instantaneous fishing mortality (F. le size-selective removal at similar F levels may only be useful to reduce the biomass below 60{\%} of virgin biomass. CARPSIM simulations show that the probability is small for any removal-based method achieving {\textless}10{\%} of virgin biomass when F{\textless}1.4.

abstract = {Changes in the timing of migratory events have been observed recently in many migratory species, most likely in response to climatic change. In the common tern Sterna hirundo we examined such changes in spring arrival date and body mass based on an individual-based longitudinal data set from a transponder marked colony from 1994 to 2012. Although no long-term trend was observed in either trait, strong inter-annual and age-specific variation in arrival date and mass was evident. We investigated whether environmental factors such as (i) global climate phenomena, i.e., North Atlantic and Southern Oscillation Indices, NAOI and SOI, and/or (ii) local factors, i.e., food abundance in the wintering and breeding area represented by fish stock or marine primary productivity, could explain this variation.We found that 2-year-old birds on their first spring migration advanced arrival in relation to spring NAOI and delayed arrival in relation to sprat Sprattus sprattus abundance. The arrival date of 3-year-olds also advanced in relation to NAOI and delayed in relation to winter SOI. In contrast, adults delayed arrival with NAOI and advanced in relation to SOI. Within age groups, earlier annual arrival coincided with higher mass, indicating that a fast and/or early migration did not come at a cost to body condition. Changes in arrival mass relative to environmental covariates were found only in 2-year-olds on their first spring migration: in these birds arrival mass was positively related to herring Clupea harengus and sprat abundance in the breeding area as well as spring NAOI and negatively related to SOI. In conclusion, traits related to migration of common terns were linked with environmental conditions, but showed no long-term trends over the past two decades. Age-related differences were marked, suggesting that common terns might be subject to differing environmental constraints or respond differently to conditions during their annual cycle depending on their age.},

abstract = {Selective predation can lead to natural selection in prey populations and may alleviate competition among surviving individuals. The processes of selection and competition can have substantial effects on prey population dynamics, but are rarely studied simultaneously. Moreover, field studies of predator-induced short-term selection pressures on prey populations are scarce. Here we report measurements of density dependence in body composition in a bivalve prey (edible cockle, Cerastoderma edule) during bouts of intense predation by an avian predator (Red Knot, Calidris canutus). We measured densities, patchiness, morphology, and body composition (shell and flesh mass) of cockles in a quasi-experimental setting, i.e., before and after predation in three similar plots of 1 ha each, two of which experienced predation, and one of which remained unvisited in the course of the short study period and served as a reference. An individual's shell and flesh mass declined with cockle density (negative density dependence). Before predation, cockles were patchily distributed. After predation, during which densities were reduced by 78{\%} (from 232 to 50 cockles/m2), the patchiness was substantially reduced, i.e., the spatial distribution was homogenized. Red Knots selected juvenile cockles with an average length of 6.9 ± 1.0 mm (mean ± SD). Cockles surviving predation had heavier shells than before predation (an increase of 21.5 percentage points), but similar flesh masses. By contrast, in the reference plot shell mass did not differ statistically between initial and final sampling occasions, while flesh mass was larger (an increase of 13.2 percentage points). In this field study, we show that Red Knots imposed a strong selection pressure on cockles to grow fast with thick shells and little flesh mass, with selection gradients among the highest reported in the literature.},

For example, in Chapter 14, we used six body measurements collected on 1100 sparrows. One option is to analyse each variable separately using univariate methods. But this is a time-consuming process and, moreover, the multivariate nature of the data is not taken into account. A sensible approach is then to apply multivariate techniques, and obvious candidates are often principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis (DA). These techniques were discussed in Chapters 12 and 14. DA can be used if there is a grouping in the observations, as we had for the sparrow data (different observers, species or sex). Although PCA was successfully applied on the dolphin data in Chapter 29, there is a problem with PCA if it is applied on morphometric data.},

abstract = {We analysed five data sets of night directions of migrating arctic waders ill relation to,winds, recorded by tracking radar and optical range finder, in order to find out if these birds compensate for wind drift, or allow themselves to be drifted by winds. Our purpose was to investigate whether arctic waders use adaptive wind drift strategies or not. The data sets were collected in Siberia (two sets) and Canada during post-breeding (autumn) migration, and in Mauritania and South Sweden during pre-breeding (spring) migration. Both significant drift and compensation effects were found in three of the data sets, Canada, Mauritania and South Sweden. Almost no compensation was found in birds departing in easterly directions from the Siberian tundra (complete drift), while no drift effect was found in birds departing in westerly directions (complete compensation). There were indications that at least some populations of waders may use an adaptive drift strategy consisting of drift at high altitude and/or in high wind speed combined with compensation at low altitude and/or in lower wind speeds, but support for this idea was rather weak and not consistent. Our results were instead more in accordance with the adaptive drift theory that predicts initial drift during the migratory journey, followed by compensation during later stages as the birds are approaching their destinations. Such a strategy implies that arctic waders, at least adult birds, have the capacity of true navigation. A comparison with earlier studies of migrating arctic waders from different parts of the world show that all results so far may be interpreted in accordance with this general adaptive drift strategy An element of non-adaptive drift can, however, not be completely ruled out.},

abstract = {The Dunlin (Calidris alpina) is a polytypic shorebird with complex patterns of distribution and migration throughout its holarctic range. We analyzed mark–resighting data obtained between 1977 and 2010 from birds captured at two major staging areas in western Alaska to test the hypothesis that the migration patterns of Alaskan populations are a mixture of parallel and chain, similar to those of Dunlin populations in the western Palearctic. Birds marked on the Yu- kon–Kuskokwim Delta were found wintering in both Asia and North America, which documented the unexpected mix- ing of C. a. arcticola from northern Alaska and C. a. pacifica from western Alaska and contradicted our initial prediction of parallel migration pathways for these two subspecies. In its North American winter range C. a. pacifica segregated ac- cording to location of marking, confirming our prediction of a chain migration pattern within this population. Individu- als of C. a. pacifica marked on the delta were resighted significantly farther north, mostly in southern British Columbia and Washington, than birds marked on the second, more southerly staging area on the Alaska Peninsula, which were resighted primarily in the San Francisco Bay area of northern California. We recommend additional studies use a com- bination of intrinsic and extrinsic markers to quantify the strength of migratory connectivity between breeding, staging, and wintering areas. Such information is needed to guide conservation efforts because the Dunlin and other waterbirds are losing intertidal habitats at an unprecedented rate and scale, particularly in the Yellow Sea and other parts of Asia.},

abstract = {The role of infaunal predators in structuring marine soft-bottom communities was evaluated according to these predators': 1) effects on prey density based on manipulative field experiments, 2) feeding rates, 3) effects on prey distribution, 4) effects on species diversity, and 5) interactions with their prey. Estimates of feeding rates indicate that many predatory taxa have the potential to reduce the size of prey populations and suggest that nemerteans are likely to have a larger impact on infaunal abundances than polychaetes. Infaunal predators have been demonstrated to have a significant effect on infaunal densities and to affect the spatial and temporal distribution of their prey. The effects of these predators on species diversity apparently depend on the predator and the diversity of the system. These conclusions may not be applicable to all soft-bottom habitats or all groups of infaunal predators because they are based on studies of very few taxa conducted almost exclusively in intertidal, unvegetated, mud habitats. Additional studies are needed on the effects of predation by infauna on infaunal population dynamics and on the mechanisms of interactions between predator and prey. Further investigation will probably reveal that different groups of infaunal predators play different roles in structuring soft-bottom communities.},

abstract = {We examined habitat preferences of 106 radio-marked Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) in the San Francisco Bay estuary during winter and spring at two scales: comparing proportions of habitats in their home range with habitats available in the study area (second-order selection), and comparing proportions of radio locations in different hab- itats with their availability in the home range (third-order selection). Daily and seasonal habitat preferences differed significantly as habitat availability changed temporally. Under second-order selection, Western Sandpipers preferred tidal sloughs and mud flats on winter low tides, and salt-pond levees at high tides. They preferred salt-pond levees and mud flats at low tides, and salt-pond levees at high tides under third-order selection. During the spring, their preferred habitats were drained and tidal salt ponds, and seasonal wetlands at high tide. At low tide, their preferred habitats were tidal sloughs and tidal salt ponds. Salt-marsh plains were the least preferred habitats during both seasons. Adults were more selective than juveniles in use of low tide habitats, but salt-pond levees were the most preferred habitats for both. Habitat preferences varied considerably when different estimates of habitat avail- ability and use were used. If mud-flat habitats were measured as linear foraging areas along the tide line, the preference for those habitats increased from second to first. When second- order selection was estimated from radio locations rather than home ranges, the resulting composition was similar to third-order selection. Our results suggest that regional conser- vation plans that restore salt marshes for the benefit of endangered species must consider the effects of losing artificial salt-pond habitats, which are locally important for sandpipers.},

Predictions based on this model are then tested against all same autumn ringing recoveries of first-season Pied Flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, ringed in Scandinavia and European Robins, Erithacus rubecula, ringed in Sweden and Finland and recovered north of the Sahara Desert.

abstract = {Altered predation risk in urban environments may contribute to animals becoming successfully urbanized by individuals from rural habitats. Escape behaviour has evolved to allow an individual to escape once captured by a predator. We tested whether altered predation risk in urban environments is associated with colonization of such habitats by comparing escape behaviour of 1132 individual birds belonging to 15 species from nearby rural and urban populations when captured by a human. Raptors (of which the Eurasian sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, was one of the most common species) were more common in rural than in urban habitats, whereas cats, Felis catus, showed the opposite pattern. There were consistent differences in escape behaviour between habitats, showing divergence in behaviour from the ancestral rural state. Urban birds wriggled less, showed higher tonic immobility, more often lost feathers, were less aggressive by biting less often, and emitted fear screams and alarm calls more often than rural birds. Furthermore, differences in escape behaviour between habitats were related to susceptibility to predation by sparrowhawks, as expected if differences in behaviour were due to differences in predation risk. Finally, an analysis of differences in escape behaviour between rural and urban birds revealed a significant relationship with time since urbanization, suggesting that escape behaviour has changed in urban environments over time. These findings suggest that release from predation and change in predator community associated with urbanization has altered the antipredator behaviour of birds colonizing towns and cities. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {The Mantel correlogram is an elegant way to compute a correlogram for multivariate data. However, recent papers raised concerns about the power of the Mantel test itself. Hence the question: Is the Mantel correlogram powerful enough to be useful? To explore this issue, we compared the performances of the Mantel correlogram to those of other methods, using numerical simulations based on random, normally distributed data. For a single response variable, we compared it to the Moran and Geary correlograms. Type I error rates of the three methods were correct. Power of the Mantel correlogram was nearly as high as that of the univariate methods. For the multivariate case, the test of the multivariate variogram developed in the context of multiscale ordination is in fact a Mantel test, so that the power of the two methods is the same by definition. We devised an alternative permutation test based on the variance, which yielded similar results. Overall, the power of the Mantel test was high, the method successfully detecting spatial correlation at rates similar to the permutation test of the variance statistic in multivariate variograms. We conclude that the Mantel correlogram deserves its place in the ecologist's toolbox.},

abstract = {We present the first continent-wide analysis of the population trends of European breeding birds to show that populations of Afro-Palearctic migrant birds have shown a pattern of sustained, often severe, decline. The mean trend of inter-continental migrants was significantly negative between 1970 and 1990 and non-significantly so between 1990 and 2000. Mean population trends were positively correlated between periods, suggesting little change in the trajectory of most migrant species' populations over this 30-year period. In both periods, trends of inter-continental migrants were significantly more negative than those of short-distance migrants or residents. This negative trend appeared to be largely, although not entirely, due to declines in species wintering in dry, open habitats in Africa. Analyses of trends of 30 closely related pairs of species, one a long-distance migrant and the other not, indicated significantly more negative trends in the former, irrespective of breeding habitat. Conservation action to address these declines is required under the Convention on Migratory Species and the Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy, to which most European countries are signatories and which aim, respectively, to conserve migratory species and to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010. Our results indicate that more conservation action may be required outside Europe to achieve these targets. Further research is needed to assess whether the declines are caused by factors operating on the birds' wintering grounds, breeding grounds or on migration routes, and to identify ways to reverse them.},

There is considerable theoretical support for early warning signals, but there is a critical lack of field observations to test the efficacy of early warning signals at spatial and temporal scales relevant for ecosystem management. Conditional heteroskedasticity is persistent periods of high and low variance that may be a powerful leading indicator of regime shift. We evaluated conditional heteroskedasticity as an early warning indicator by applying moving window conditional heteroskedasticity tests to time series of chlorophyll-a and fish catches derived from a whole-lake experiment designed to create a regime shift. There was significant conditional heteroskedasticity at least a year prior to the regime shift in the manipulated lake but there was no significant conditional heteroskedasticity in an adjacent reference lake. Conditional heteroskedasticity was an effective leading indicator of regime shift for the ecosystem manipulation.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the length of time spent at migratory stopover sites, or stopover duration, can help biologists estimate the total number of birds passing through a site, which in turn can be used to estimate population size. We estimated the stopover duration for 106 radiomarked pectoral sandpipers (Calidris melanotos) in the Lower Mississippi River Alluvial Valley (MAV) during fall migrations in 2001 and 2002. We estimated time-at-site-after-capture by tracking radiomarked birds daily to determine their time of departure from stopover sites. We used length-biased sampling and program DISTANCE to estimate stopover duration from time-at-site-after-capture. Our estimate of stopover duration for pectoral sandpipers in the MAV over all sites and both years was 10.0 days (95{\%} Cl = 8.2-11.7). Aerial telemetry relocations from 2002 indicated that many pectoral sandpipers used multiple stopover sites during their migration through the MAV, which suggested that the total time spent by pectoral sandpipers in the MAV during fall migration, or turnover rate, was,longer than the stopover duration. Future research should focus on estimating the number of stopover sites used by pectoral sandpipers and determine whether other shore-bird species use multiple sites as well. If shorebirds migrating through the MAV stay in the region for a period longer than the 10 days suggested by the Lower Mississippi Valley joint Venture (LMVJV) Migratory Bird Science Team in their modeling of shorebird energetic requirements then more habitat may be required by shorebirds during fall migration than the 2,000 ha the group calculated for the MAV.},

abstract = {In the course of each spring, two subspecies of knots Calidris canutus (islandica wintering in Europe and breeding in the Nearctic, and canutus wintering in west Africa and breeding in Siberia), stage in the international Wadden Sea before their northward flights to the arctic breeding grounds. In March-April islandica-knots predominantly use the intertidal flats in the western part of the Wadden Sea in The Netherlands (canutus is still in west Africa). In May both subspecies use the eastern part of the Wadden Sea in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany only. We studied these knots in core areas at both ends of the Wadden Sea in 1990, to examine whether the absence of knots in the western Wadden Sea in May is related to food resources or to other factors connected with the energy budget of these long-distance migrants. Islandica-knots in March-April in The Netherlands and canutus-knots in May in Germany had similar diets and showed similar size selection of their major bivalve prey Macoma balthica, giving the possibility for indirect competitive interactions. Knots spent more time feeding per day in Germany. The harvestable biomass of Macoma was of comparable magnitude in both parts of the Wadden Sea in May. That knots always leave the western Wadden Sea in late April is, therefore not a direct response to prey depletion. If Macoma always subsides earlier in tile year in the western part of the Wadden Sea than in the east as in 1990, the knots' absence in the west may represent the riding of an eastward wave of good feeding conditions resulting from longitudinal variation in bivalve-prey biology. At least for canutus, the reliance in May on the eastern Wadden Sea may (additionally?) represent early movements - at relatively low body masses towards the breeding areas to gain the benefits of a small saving on the cost and time of travel, and of bring closer to the weather systems that may help their flight into the breeding areas.},

In groups, however, nonvigilant individuals could benefit from the vigilance of others without any of the associated costs. In an evolutionary sense, such exploitation may be compensated if vigilant individuals have a survival advantage. The novelty in our model is that the probability to detect a predator is “distance dependent.” We show that even if nonvigilant individuals benefit fully from information produced by vigilant individuals, vigilant individuals nevertheless enjoy a survival advantage. This happens because detection of predators is more likely when vigilant individuals happen to be targets of predation. We expect this distance-dependent mechanism to be compatible with previously reported mechanisms.},

abstract = {One of the characteristics of avian migration is its variability within and among species. Variation in migratory behavior, and in physiological and morphological adaptations to migration, is to a large extent due to genetic differences. Comparative studies suggest that migratory behavior has rapidly and independently evolved in different lineages. One reason behind the high potential for de novo evolution of migratory behavior in sedentary populations seems to be the ubiquity of genetic variation for migratory traits in nonmigratory individuals. In resident lineages, a high degree of hidden genetic variation for migratory traits can be maintained because a migratory threshold determines whether migratory behavior is expressed. Genetic correlations among migratory traits and with other traits of the annual cycle are likely to play a major role in determining the rate and direction of evolutionary change.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Salinization is having a major impact on wetlands and its biota worldwide. Specifically, many migratory animals that rely on wetlands are increasingly exposed to elevated salinity on their nonbreeding grounds. Experimental evidence suggests that physiological challenges associated with increasing salinity may disrupt self-maintenance processes in these species. Nonetheless, the potential role of salinity as a driver of ecological carry-over effects remains unstudied. Here, we investigated the extent to which the use of saline wetlands during winter - inferred from feather stable isotope values - induces residual effects that carry over and influence physiological traits relevant to fitness in black-tailed godwits Limosa limosa limosa on their northward migration. Overwintering males and females were segregated by wetland salinity in West Africa, with females mostly occupying freshwater wetlands. The use of these wetlands along a gradient of salinities was associated with differences in immune responsiveness to phytohaemagglutinin and sized-corrected body mass in godwits staging in southern Europe during northward migration - 3,000 km from the nonbreeding grounds - but in males only. These findings provide a window onto the processes by which wetland salinity can induce carry-over effects and can help predict how migratory species should respond to future climate-induced increases in salinity.},

abstract = {Partner choice is important in nature, and partnerships or coalitions within which reproduction is shared are the subject of growing interest. However, little attention has been given to questions of which individuals are suitable partners and why. Common eider (Somateria mollissima) females sometimes pool their broods and share brood-rearing duties, and body condition affects care decisions. We constructed a model in which females, based on their body condition and the structure of the joint brood, assess the fitness consequences of joining a coalition versus tending for young alone. We tested the model's predictions by comparing data on the condition of females in enduring and transient coalitions. Our model showed that the range of acceptable brood arrays in a female coalition decreases with increasing condition of the female, so females tending alone should be in better condition than multifemale tenders. This prediction is in agreement with previous data. The model also predicts that females in good condition should join coalitions with females in poor condition and not with other females in good condition. This prediction was also supported by data: in enduring two-female coalitions, the positive correlation between the better female's condition and the difference in condition between the two females was stronger than would be expected by random grouping of females. In contrast, in transient coalitions of females, this correlation did not differ from the correlation expected under random grouping. Model assumptions seem to fit with eider natural history, and the model may prove to be a useful way to study brood amalgamation behavior of waterfowl in general. Key words: body condition, brood amalgamation, coalitions, common eider, parental care, partner choice, solitary tending, Somateria mollissima.},

abstract = {Foragers that feed on hidden prey are uncertain about the intake rate they can achieve as they enter a patch. However, foraging success can inform them, especially if they have prior knowledge about the patch quality distribution in their environment. We experimentally tested whether and how red knots (Calidris canutus) use such information and whether their patch-leaving decisions maximized their long-term net energy intake rate. The results suggest that the birds combined patch sample information with prior knowledge by making use of the potential value assessment rule. We reject five alternative leaving rules. The potential encounter rate that the birds choose as their critical departure threshold maximized their foraging gain ratio (a modified form of efficiency) while foraging. The high experimental intake rates were constrained by rate of digestion. Under such conditions, maximization of the foraging gain ratio during foraging maximizes net intake rate during total time (foraging time plus digestive breaks). We conclude that molluscivore red knots, in the face of a digestive constraint, are able to combine prior environmental knowledge about patch quality with patch sample information to obtain the highest possible net intake over total time.},

The experiments consisted of exclusion ceilings and controls (both 1 m(2)), with 10 replicates each and aligned at the same tidal level. During December 1994- May 1995 these experiments were done, twice in Bahia Samborombon, twice at two sites (Sotelo and Celpa) 4 km apart in Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon, and three times in Bahia Blanca. Three polychaete species (Laconcreis actua, Nephtys fluviatilis, and Heteromastus similis) were found in similar densities in both areas of the Mar Chiquita lagoon. L. acuta and N. fluviatilis were affected in Sotelo, but there was no treatment effect in Celpa. In Sotelo the most abundant shorebirds were Hudsonian godwit (Limosa haemastica), American golden plover (Pluvialis dominica), and White-rumped sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis), and in Celpa the most abundant shorebirds were White-rumped plover (Charadrius falklandicus), and lesser yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes). The largest polychaete densities were in the upper sediment layer (0-6 cm), which was also the most affected layer. Three polychaete species were found in Bahia Samborombon (L. acuta, N. similis, and Neanthes succinea), but only H. similis showed a treatment effect. The most abundant shorebirds in Samborombon were white-rumped sandpiper and two-banded plover. No effect was detected in Bahia Blanca, where the most abundant shorebirds were white-rumped sandpiper and American golden plover. In all cases, the species affected by shorebirds were the most abundant species. From the two sites of Mar Chiquita, there was a treatment effect only in Sotelo, which was also the area with higher shorebirds counts. However, much lower densities observed in Samborombon (similar to the unaffected area of Mar Chiquita) also produced a significant decrease in infaunal abundance. These evidences also suggest that just selection of study sites may produce different views of the interaction between shorebirds and benthic species.},

abstract = {When approached by humans, virtually all species flee, but we lack an understanding of the factors that influence flight response among species. Understanding this variation may allow us to understand how 'fear' structures communities, as well as to predict which species are likely to coexist with humans. I used flight initiation distance (FID) as a comparative metric of wariness and examined the relative importance of life history and natural history traits in explaining variation in FID in 150 species of birds. In a series of comparative analyses, I used independent contrasts to control for phylogenetic similarity and regressed continuous life history traits against flight initiation distance. Body size had a large and significant effect in explaining variation in flightiness: larger species initiated flight at greater distances than smaller species. After controlling for variation explained by body size, there was a nonsignificant positive relation between the age of first reproduction and FID. There were no relations between FID and clutch size, number of days spent feeding young, longevity, or habitat density. I used concentrated changes tests to look for evidence of coevolution between flightiness and dichotomous traits. Flightiness evolved multiple times and some clades were flightier than others. Flightiness was more likely to evolve in omnivorous/carnivorous species and in cooperatively breeding species. These results suggest that body size and age of first reproduction are important in explaining variation in disturbance tolerance in birds, and that species that capture live prey and those that are highly social are relatively wary. The results suggest a novel mechanism of how anthropogenic disturbance may contribute to extinction. ?? 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {During the highest spring tides the intertidal sediment flats of estuaries are fully inundated at high water, and waders have no choice but to move to supratidal roosts, e.g. on open farmland, saltpans or beaches. However, in many estuaries during the lowest neap or intermediate tides there are sectors of upper intertidal sediment flats that remain exposed even at the peak of high water, and so waders have the choice of roosting either there or in supratidal sites. In the Tagus Estuary, Portugal, as elsewhere, waders use both types of roosts during high water. Our main objective was to understand what makes waders opt for one of these two types of available roosts. We monitored wader use of saltpans and intertidal roosts from spring to neap tides, and measured foraging and alarm behaviour, prey availability and disturbance by predators. Most of the wader species studied chose intertidal (mudflat) roosts whenever these were available, and only roosted in saltpans during the peak of spring tides. We hypothesized that this preference was explained either by an attempt (i) to continue feeding into the high water period, or (ii) to minimize predation risk. Extending feeding time into the high water period did not seem to be very relevant for roost choice because both prey availability and foraging activity were low in both types of roosts. However, predator disturbance was several times higher in the saltpans than in the intertidal roosts, suggesting that this factor may be the determinant in the choice of roost type.},

Hatch-year catbirds were less efficient foragers than AHY catbirds; however, efficiency improved with age to the extent that many HY catbirds are probably as efficient as AHY birds by the time they commence migration. We discovered age-dependent patterns of fat deposition, which probably resulted from differences in foraging efficiency and molt timing. Hatch-year catbirds began to deposit fat sooner than AHY catbirds but did so more slowly throughout the postbreeding and premigratory phases of the annual cycle. Adult catbirds did not become hyperphagic until they neared the completion of their molt, then deposited fat rapidly.},

We collected data on lay dates of 7 bird species, representing shorebirds, passerines, a bird of prey, and seabirds, nesting on Herschel Island, Yukon, Canada, in the years 1984–1986 and 2007–2009. Snowmelt was significantly earlier in the 2007–2009 period. Shorebirds and passerines showed trends to earlier lay dates in conjunction with earlier snowmelt; the other species did not. The strength of response in lay date was correlated with the general cate- gories of foods known to be used by study species. How- ever, six species showed a longer time interval between snowmelt and egg-laying in early compared to late springs, suggesting the need for further monitoring of how robust their responses to snowmelt are in the future.

abstract = {Predators can affect individual fitness and population and community processes through lethal effects (direct consumption or 'density' effects), where prey is consumed, or through non-lethal effects (trait-mediated effects or interactions), where behavioural compensation to predation risk occurs, such as animals avoiding areas of high predation risk. Studies of invertebrates, fish and amphibians have shown that non-lethal effects may be larger than lethal effects in determining the behaviour, condition, density and distribution of animals over a range of trophic levels. Although non-lethal effects have been well described in the behavioural ecology of birds (and also mammals) within the context of anti-predation behaviour, their role relative to lethal effects is probably underestimated. Birds show many behavioural and physiological changes to reduce direct mortality from predation and these are likely to have negative effects on other aspects of their fitness and population dynamics, as well as affecting the ecology of their own prey and their predators. As a consequence, the effects of predation in birds are best measured by trade-offs between maximizing instantaneous survival in the presence of predators and acquiring or maintaining resources for long-term survival or reproduction. Because avoiding predation imposes foraging costs, and foraging behaviour is relatively easy to measure in birds, the foraging-predation risk trade-off is probably an effective framework for understanding the importance of non-lethal effects, and so the population and community effects of predation risk in birds and other animals. Using a trade-off approach allows us to predict better how changes in predator density will impact on population and community dynamics, and how animals perceive and respond to predation risk, when non-lethal effects decouple the relationship between predator density and direct mortality rate. The trade-off approach also allows us to identify where predation risk is structuring communities because of avoidance of predators, even when this results in no observable direct mortality rate.},

@article{Dingle2006a,
abstract = {Ornithologists, and especially northern hemisphere ornithologists, have traditionally thought of migration as an annual return movement of populations between regular breeding and non-breeding grounds. Problems arise because selection does not ordinarily act on populations and because organisms of many taxa (including birds) are clearly migrants, but fail to undertake movements of the kind described. There are also extensive return movements that are not migratory. I propose that it is more useful to think of migration as a syndrome of behavioral and other traits that function together within individuals, and that such a syndrome provides a common ground across taxa from aphids to albatrosses. Large-scale return movements of populations are one outcome of the syndrome. Similar behavioral and physiological traits serve both to define migration and to provide a test for it. I use two insect (Hemipteran) examples to illustrate migratory syndromes and to demonstrate that, in many migrants, behavior and physiology correlate with life history and morphological traits to form syndromes at two levels. I then compare the two Hemipterans with migration in birds, butterflies, and fish to assess the question of whether there are migratory syndromes in common between these diverse migrants. Syndromes are more similar at the level of behavior than when morphology and life history traits are included. Recognizing syndromes leads to important evolutionary questions concerning migration strategies, trade-offs, the maintenance of genetic variance and the responses of migratory syndromes to both similar and different selective regimes.},

abstract = {The efficiency of sorting of meiofaunal taxa from coarse and muddy marine sediments is assessed. For sandy sediments (mean {\%} Silt + clay (S/C) = 8.5), the manual mixing in tap water and immediate decantation, repeated ten times, offers a 100 {\%} efficiency. For muddy sediments, two sets of random samples (mean {\%} S/C = 39 and 56 respectively) were compared using a flotation technique in a high density sugar solution. There are no differences in the efficiency of extraction using: manual mix in 200 mL flasks (method 1) and machine (vortex) mix in several 50 mL centrifuge tubes (method 2). Method 1 is recommended because of shorter time of processing, reduced potential error of manipulation and efficiency is independent of sediment size particle. For quantitative extraction of nematodes, three repeated extractions are acceptable; however, the sorting of less abundant taxa (e.g. copepods) should demand more processing steps},

abstract = {Rich habitats, intensive feeding, and large fuel deposits are assumed to improve the capability for long-distance migration by birds but may also heighten their vulnerability or exposure to predators. Studies of habitat use by migrants have emphasized the importance of feeding, and relatively few studies have considered how migrants manage the dangers inherent in acquiring and storing fuel. Migrant western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) stop over on coastal mudflats characterized by a strong feeding-danger gradient, with both food and danger decreasing with distance from the shoreline. We experimentally manipulated danger by adding obstructive cover and measured sandpiper usage along this gradient. We compared sandpiper usage along a transect extending 100 m on either side of the obstruction with that on matched control transects without obstructions. The dropping density accumulated during a low-tide period provided a sensitive measure of sandpiper usage. Mean usage on control transects was 2.3 droppings/m(2) and was lower by 1.5 droppings/m(2) (65{\%}) on treatment transects. Usage did not differ between control and treatment transects at the furthest distances from the obstruction, the difference increased with proximity to the obstruction, and was greater by on average 0.9 droppings/m(2) on the oceanward side (low food abundance) than on the shoreward side (high food abundance). All these findings were predicted by danger management theory. Our study provides experimental evidence that migrant birds are sensitive to danger on stopover and has implications for understanding migration strategies.},

abstract = {Recent climate change has been linked to shifts in the timing of life-cycle events in many organisms, but there is debate over the degree to which phenological changes are caused by evolved genetic responses of populations or by phenotypic plasticity of individuals. We estimated plasticity of spring arrival date in 27 species of bird that breed in the vicinity of an observatory in eastern North America. For 2441 individuals detected in multiple years, arrival occurred earlier during warm years, especially in species that migrate short distances. Phenotypic plasticity averaged -0.93 days degrees C-1 +/- 0.70 (95{\%} CI). However, plasticity accounted for only 13-25{\%} of the climate-induced trend in phenology observed over 46 years. Although our approach probably underestimates the full scope of plasticity, the data suggest that part of the response to environmental change has been caused by microevolution. The estimated evolutionary rates are plausible (0.016 haldanes).},

abstract = {Birds migrate over vast distances at substantial costs. The highly dynamic nature of the air makes the selection of the best travel route difficult. We investigated to what extent migratory birds may optimise migratory route choice with respect to wind, and if route choice can be subject to natural selection. Following the optimal route, calculated using 21 years of empirical global wind data, reduced median travel time by 26.5{\%} compared to the spatially shortest route. When we used a time-dependent survival model to quantify the adaptive benefit of choosing a fixed wind-optimised route, 84.8{\%} of pairs of locations yielded a route with a higher survival than the shortest route. This suggests that birds, even if incapable of predicting wind individually, could adjust their migratory routes at a population level. As a consequence, this may result in the emergence of low-cost flyways representing a global network of aerial migratory pathways.},

abstract = {This paper examines patterns of larval clam settlement on soft-bottom intertidal plots in British Columbia, Canada relative to predator netting (used in beach culture of clams) and adult populations. We studied four sites over two years. Each site had a netted and nonnetted plot where level of clam recruitment was compared. Density (spat/m(2)) of early recruits was measured for each plot at each site. We found that year (P = 0.0001) was a significant factor, and netting was weakly significant (P = 0.064) in influencing early recruitment of clams. Netted plots also contained high densities of adult clams. Adult filter feeders have been presumed to decrease larval settlement by filtration of recruits. We found that at lower adult density, the relationship between density of spat and density of adults was negative (as predicted). However, at higher densities of adults (450/m(2)), this relationship no longer held and spat density increased slightly with increase in adult density. Neither presence of netting nor extremely high adult density prevented recruitment of clam larvae, and in plots with nets and high numbers of adults there remained a strong level of recruitment. Our results showed recruitment of bivalve larvae is variable annually and also varies among sites, highlighting the importance of adequate replication of sites and samples to ensure accurate reflection of recruitment patterns. We also found that other factors, netting and adult density, can influence the level of recruitment. Further research is needed to determine whether the magnitude of influence will translate into changes in ultimate population patterns.},

abstract = {The persistence of prey encountering intense predation varies by species, prey density, and habitat type; however, the collective impact of these factors has rarely been tested experimentally in natural marine systems. Using the thin-shelled clams Mya arenaria and Macoma balthica as prey, and the main epibenthic predator of whole adult clams, the blue crab Callinectes sapidus, we conducted a series of experiments in Chesapeake Bay tributaries that (1) links field abundance and distribution of bivalve prey species with habitat-specific mortality patterns; (2) represents the first comprehensive field test of species-specific, habitat-specific, and density-dependent mortality for subtidal, soft-bottom, deep-burrowing prey; and (3) thereby enables development of a conceptual model to be used as a heuristic tool linking predator-prey dynamics, habitat type, and evolutionary defense tactics for marine benthos. In 15 years of field monitoring, Mya was more common in sand than mud habitats, and Macoma was widely distributed and at higher densities than Mya in mud and sand. In field experiments, mortality of both Mya and Macoma was density dependent in those habitats where the clams are common. The blue crab population in the field exhibited a type III "guild functional response" on Mya in sand, and on Macoma in both mud and sand. Mortality was lower in sand than mud for Mya, and similar in mud and sand for Macoma, correlating with the high abundances of Mya in sand and Macoma in sand and mud. The persistence of large juvenile and adult bivalves when confronted with intense predation derived substantially from a low-density refuge from predation that varied in a species-specific manner with habitat type, demonstrating the species-specific importance of density and habitat to clam survival. We developed a conceptual model detailing the relative importance of behavior, morphology, habitat features, and the basic components of predator-prey interactions to the survival of bivalve molluscs. At one extreme are bivalve molluscs, such as oysters, that emphasize morphological refuges that increase the predator's handling time. At the other extreme are bivalves, such as Mya and Macoma, that reduce predator encounter rates. The model is intended to be used as a heuristic tool to develop testable hypotheses.},

By complex, I mean a model that contains terms related by marginality or hierarchy, such as polynomial terms, or main eﬀects and interactions. I call these tables or graphs eﬀect displays. Eﬀect displays are constructed by identifying high-order terms in a generalised linear model. Fitted values under the model are computed for each such term. The lower-order ‘relatives' of a high-order term (e.g., main eﬀects marginal to an interaction) are absorbed into the term, allowing the predictors appearing in the high-order term to range over their values. The values of other predictors are ﬁxed at typical values: for example, a covariate could be ﬁxed at its mean or median, a factor at its proportional distribution in the data, or to equal proportions in its several levels. Variations of eﬀect displays are also described, including representation of terms higher-order to any appearing in the model.},

abstract = {Canada's Wild Salmon Policy requires that biological status of conservation units of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) be assessed regularly in relation to abundance-based benchmarks. Visual survey methods, in which periodic counts of spawning fish are made throughout a season, will likely be used for this purpose because they provide a cost-effective means of monitoring interannual trends in escapement. Trend detection performance for visual survey methods depends mainly upon consistency in (i) the ability of observers to detect fish and (ii) the annual timing of fish presence in the survey area. We developed a Monte Carlo simulation procedure to evaluate the ability of four visual survey methods (peak count, mean count, trapezoidal area-under-the-curve (AUC), and likelihood AUC) to detect 30{\%} declines in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) escapement over 10 years (i.e., the magnitude of trend that would warrant listing a coho population as threatened using the listing criteria of the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)) given realistic levels of variability in these two factors. The mean count outperformed all other approaches across a wide range of scenarios about true population dynamics and survey designs, suggesting that a simple mean count method is suitable for monitoring coho escapements in relation to COSEWIC guidelines.},

abstract = {The theory of sexual selection was developed to explain the evolution of highly exaggerated sexual ornaments. Now supported by vast empirical evidence, sexual selection is generally considered to favour individuals with the most extreme trait expression. Here we describe disruptive selection on a sexual ornament, plumage coloration, in yearling male lazuli buntings (Passerina amoena). In habitats with limited good-quality nesting cover, the dullest and the brightest yearlings were more successful in obtaining high-quality territories, pairing with females and siring offspring, than yearlings with intermediate plumage. This pattern reflects the way that territorial adult males vary levels of aggression to influence the structure of their social neighbourhood. Adult males showed less aggression towards dull yearlings than intermediate and bright ones, permitting the dull yearlings to settle on good territories nearby. Fitness comparisons based on paternity analyses showed that both the adults and dull yearlings benefited genetically from this arrangement, revealing a rare example of sexually selected male-male cooperation.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The seasonal phenology of latitudinal movements is one of the key life-history traits of migratory birds. We used quantile regression to examine long-term changes in the timing of spring and autumn migration in 5 species of migratory passerine birds captured at a banding station in northern California, USA, over a 22 yr period from 1987 to 2008. Our 5 study species included 3 short-distance migrants, Pacific-slope Flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis), Orange-crowned Warbler (Oreothlypis celata), and Wilson's Warbler (Cardellina pusilla); and 2 long-distance migrants, Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus) and Yellow Warbler (Setophaga petechia). Median timing of migration advanced in spring for 2 of the 5 species (?2.5 days decade?1) but was delayed during autumn migration for 3 of the species (+2.9 days decade?1). The duration of the migration period also became compressed in some species but more protracted in others. We tested whether annual variation in migration timing was related to 3 indices of regional climatic conditions: the Pacific?North American index, multivariate El Ni{\~{n}}o?Southern Oscillation index, and North Atlantic Oscillation index. Climate indices explained relatively little of the variation in migration timing (r2 {\textless} 0.35), but advances in spring migration and delays in autumn migration were associated with warm, wet conditions during positive phases of the climate indices. The strongest effects of climatic conditions on migration timing were found among short-distance migrants, with the largest changes in timing due to variation in the El Ni{\~{n}}o?Southern Oscillation and Pacific?North American indices. Linkages between the timing of movements and climatic conditions indicate that passerine birds on the Pacific coast exhibit phenotypic plasticity in their migration timing, but future studies based on experimental methods are needed to test alternative ecological mechanisms.},

abstract = {When animals can choose from a range of feeding options, often those options with a higher energetic gain carry a higher risk of predation. This paper analyses the optimal trade-off between food and predation. We are primarily interested in how an animal's decisions and its state change over time. Our models are very general. They can be applied to growth decisions, such as choice of habitat, in which case we might consider how the state variable size changes over an animal's lifetime. Equally our models are applicable to short-term foraging decisions, such as vigilance level, in which case we might consider how energy reserves vary over a day. We concentrate on two cases: (i) the animal must reach a fixed state, its fitness depending on when this is attained; (ii) the animal must survive to a fixed time, its fitness depending on its final state. In case (i) minimization of mortality per unit increase of state is optimal under certain baseline conditions. In case (ii) behaviour is constant over time under baseline conditions (the 'Risk-spreading Theorem'). We analyse how these patterns are modified by complicating factors, e.g. time penalties, premature termination of the food supply, stochasticity in food supply or in metabolic expenditure, and state-dependence in the ability to obtain food, in metabolic expenditure and in predation risk. From this analysis we obtain a variety of possible explanations for why an animal should reduce its intake rate over time (i.e. show satiation). We show how -earlier work can be viewed as special cases of our results.},

abstract = {Understanding decisions is the fundamental aim of the behavioural sciences. The theory of rational choice is based on axiomatic principles such as transitivity and independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). Empirical studies have demonstrated that the behaviour of humans and other animals often seems irrational; there can be a lack of transitivity in choice and seemingly irrelevant alternatives can alter decisions. These violations of transitivity and IIA undermine rational choice theory. However, we show that an individual that is maximizing its rate of food gain can exhibit failure of transitivity and IIA. We show that such violations can be caused because a current option may disappear in the near future or a better option may reappear soon. Current food options can be indicative of food availability in the near future, and this key feature can result in apparently irrational behaviour.},

abstract = {Migratory birds are predicted to adapt their departure to wind, changing their threshold of departure and selectivity of the most favourable winds in relation to the mean, scatter and skewness of the wind regime. The optimal departure behaviour depends also on the importance of time and energy minimization during migration and on the ratio of cost of flight to cost of resting and waiting for more favourable winds. We compared departure and flight activity of shorebirds migrating in contrasting wind regimes during autumn (high probability of wind resistance) and spring (high probability of wind assistance) in southern Scandinavia, using data obtained by radiotelemetry, radar tracking and visual observations. The shorebirds changed their threshold for departure in relation to wind between the two seasons, flying almost exclusively with wind assistance in spring but regularly with wind resistance during autumn. The degree of wind selectivity in relation to the distributions of available wind effects was similar during autumn and spring indicating that reducing time and energy costs for migration was important during both seasons. These results demonstrate that migratory birds change departure behaviour in relation to the prevailing wind regime. It remains unknown whether they change behaviour not only seasonally but also in different zones along the migration route and whether they respond to differences not only in mean wind conditions but also in scatter and skewness between wind regimes. Our study indicates the possible existence of an adaptive flexibility in responses to wind regimes among migratory birds. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Personalities are general properties of humans and other animals. Different personality traits are phenotypically correlated, and heritabilities of personality traits have been reported in humans and various animals. In great tits, consistent heritable differences have been found in relation to exploration, which is correlated with various other personality traits. In this paper, we investigate whether or not risk-taking behaviour is part of these avian personalities. We found that (i) risk-taking behaviour is repeatable and correlated with exploratory behaviour in wild-caught hand-reared birds, (ii) in a bi-directional selection experiment on 'fast' and 'slow' early exploratory behaviour, bird lines tend to differ in risk-taking behaviour, and (iii) within-nest variation of risk-taking behaviour is smaller than between-nest variation. To show that risk-taking behaviour has a genetic component in a natural bird population, we bred great tits in the laboratory and artificially selected 'high' and 'low' risk-taking behaviour for two generations. Here, we report a realized heritability of 19.3 +/- 3.3{\%} (s.e.m.) for risk-taking behaviour. With these results we show in several ways that risk-taking behaviour is linked to exploratory behaviour, and we therefore have evidence for the existence of avian personalities. Moreover, we prove that there is heritable variation in more than one correlated personality trait in a natural population, which demonstrates the potential for correlated evolution.},

abstract = {Long-distance migrants have evolved complex strategies for the timing of their annual moult, fattening and migration cycles. These strategies are likely to vary at different stages of a bird's life. Ringing data on 6079 Grey Plovers Pluvialis squatarola , caught on the Wash, England, between 1959 and 1996, were analysed to relate migratory strategies to patterns of primary moult and body mass changes. Adults returning from breeding grounds had a shorter and delayed primary moult (duration 90 days, starting date 19 August) in compa- rison with over-summering birds (duration 109 days, starting date 5 June). Three categories of migrant adults were identified on the basis of primary moult and body mass: (1) birds which did not moult, but increased body mass and migrated further south; (2) birds which moulted 1–3 inner primaries, suspended moult, increased body mass and migrated; and (3) birds which completed or suspended moult and wintered locally. In birds of the second cat- egory, timing of primary moult and body mass increase overlapped. Among wintering birds, 38{\%} were in suspended moult. Ninety-six per cent of birds that suspended moult at the beginning of winter were males and almost all completed moult in spring. Grey Plovers which left Britain in autumn had an average body mass of 280 g, enough to reach southern Morocco without refuelling. Both wintering adults and first-year birds showed a prewinter body mass increase, peaking in December. Adults had a synchronized premigratory body mass increase in May, which suggested a negligible presence of African migrants. The average departure mass for spring migration, estimated at 316 g, would allow birds to fly non-stop to the Siberian breeding grounds in western Taymyr.},

abstract = {We examined the reproductive success and long-term population dynamics of Neotropical migrant birds in the fragmented landscapes of Illinois. Our primary objective was to assess whether annual variation in abundances and persistence of populations within woodlots was related to variation in reproductive success. Nesting success of migrants was so low in the woodlots where we sampled that it is unlikely that these populations are self- sustaining. Moreover, populations frequently disappear from and recolonize these woodlots. These data suggest that the source-sink metaphor for population dynamics within spatially structured populations is applicable to migratory birds in Illinois. The scale of this dynamic is unknown, but may be regional (i.e., midwestern U.S.). An important implication of this result is that census data must be interpreted carefully. For one woodlot, we detected no systematic trend in the overall abundances of migratory birds over much of the 20th century. Yet the viability of populations within that woodlot likely decreased dramatically over that time owing to increasing rates of nest predation and brood parasitism. Lack of data on dispersal is a major gap in understanding the population dynamics of Neotropical Neotropical migrants and prescribing effective conservation measures.},

abstract = {When early breeding is advantageous, migrants underway to the breeding areas may be time stressed. The timing of sequential events such as migration and breeding is expected to be correlated because of a ``domino effect'', and would be of particular biological importance if timings are repeatable within individuals between years. We studied a colour-marked population of Black-tailed Godwits Limosa l. limosa both on staging areas in Portugal and on breeding areas in The Netherlands. For each individual, we measured the timing of the staging period, the arrival date on the breeding area and the egg laying date. We measured average egg volume as a measure of reproductive investment. The date of departure from the staging areas, the arrival date on the breeding areas, and the egg laying date were repeatable among years in individual Black-tailed Godwits. The arrival dates of paired males and females and the average annual male and female arrival dates were correlated. The dates of departure from Portugal, arrival in The Netherlands, and egg laying were not correlated. Earlier clutches had larger eggs than late clutches. If the length of the individually available pre-laying period is accounted for, early arriving birds spent more time on the breeding grounds before laying than late arriving birds.

abstract = {We analysed migratory connectivity between different winter quarters and breeding sectors in the circumpolar tundra region for arctic shorebirds, in relation to migratory distances and ecological barriers. Total distances and barriers were calculated and measured for all potential migratory orthodrome links between 10 selected winter regions and 12 breeding sectors. The migratory segment between the northernmost stopover site and the breeding area, associated with the entry to and exit from the tundra during spring and autumn migration, respectively, was also identified and measured for each potential link. The analysis indicated that the evolution of migratory links among arctic shorebirds is constrained not by distance as such but by distance across ecological barriers, possibly because of the complex adaptations required for barrier crossing and extensive detour migration (and in a few cases because barrier distances exceed the birds' theoretical flight range capacity). A particularly pronounced barrier effect of the Arctic Ocean, as apparent from a sharp decline in migratory connectivity between the opposite sides of the Arctic Ocean, may reflect a crucial importance of favourable entry and exit conditions for successfully occupying different sectors of the tundra breeding area by shorebirds from winter regions situated at widely different total distances in both the southern and northern hemispheres.},

abstract = {By using morphometric data and geolocator tracking we investigated fuel loads and spatio-temporal patterns of migration and non-breeding in Temminck ' s stints Calidris temminckii . Body masses in stints captured at autumn stopover sites from Scandinavia to northern Africa were generally not much higher than during breeding and did not vary geographically. Th us, we expected migrating stints to make several stopovers and either circumventing the Sahara desert with low fuel loads or fuelling at north African stopover sites before desert crossing. Geolocation revealed that birds (n ? 6) departed their Norwegian breeding site in the last part of July and all but one migrated south-west over continental western Europe. A single bird headed south-east to the Balkan Peninsula where the geolocator died. As predicted, southbound migration proceeded in a typical skipping manner with 1 – 4 relatively short stopovers (median 4 d) during 10 – 27 d of migration before reaching north-west Africa. Here birds spent 11 – 20 d before crossing the Sahara. Th e non-breeding sites were located at or near the Niger River in Mali and were occupied continuously for more than 215 d with no indications of itinerancy. Spring migration commenced in late April/early May when birds crossed the desert and used stopover sites in the western Mediterranean basin in a similar manner as during autumn. Th e lowest body masses were recorded in spring at islands in the central Mediterranean basin, indicating that crossing the Sahara and Mediterranean barriers is exhausting to these birds. Hence, the skipping-type pattern of migration revealed by geolocators is likely to be natural in this species and not an eff ect of instrumentation.},

abstract = {In most long-distance migratory birds, juveniles migrate without their parents and so are likely to lack detailed knowledge of where to go. This suggests the potential for stochas- ticity to affect their choice of wintering area at a large scale ({\textgreater} 1000 km). Adults, in con- trast, may re-use non-breeding sites that promote their survival, so removing uncertainty from their subsequent migrations. I review the evidence for large-scale stochastic juvenile site selection followed by adult site fidelity, and then develop a ‘serial-residency' hypoth- esis based on these two traits as a framework to explain both the migratory connectivity and the population dynamics of migrant birds and how these are affected by environ- mental change. Juvenile stochasticity is apparent in the age-dependent effects of weather or experimental displacement on the outcome of migration and in the very wide varia- tion in the destinations of individuals originating from the same area. Adults have been shown to be very faithful to their wintering grounds and even to staging sites. The serial residency hypothesis predicts that migrants that show these two traits will rely on an individually unique but fixed series of temporally and spatially linked sites to complete their annual cycle. As a consequence, migratory connectivity will be apparent at a very small scale for individuals, but only at a large scale for a population, and juveniles are predicted to occur more often at less suitable sites than adults, so that survival will be lower for juveniles. Migratory connectivity will arise only through spatial and temporal autocorrelation with local environmental constraints, particularly on passage, and the dis- tribution and age structure of the population may reflect past environmental constraints. At least some juveniles will discover suitable habitat that they may re-use as adults, thus promoting overall population-level resilience to environmental change, and suggesting value in site-based conservation. However, because migratory connectivity only acts on a large scale, any population of migrants will contain individuals that encounter a change in suitability somewhere in their non-breeding range, so affecting average survival. Dif- ferences in population trends will therefore reflect variation in local breeding output added to average survival from wintering and staging areas. The latter is likely to be declining given increasing levels of environmental degradation throughout Africa. Large- scale migratory connectivity also has implications for the evolutionary ecology of migrants, generally because this is likely to lead to selection for generalist traits.},

abstract = {Many northerly breeding shorebird species show a separation in timing of adult and juvenile migration. If, in addition to genetic control of migration, learning from experienced conspecifics is advantageous, juveniles should join adult birds during their first fall migration when possible. We here present a method to test if juveniles mix with adults during the period of overlap during southward migration, using dunlin Calidris alpina migrating over southern Sweden as an example. While taking timing differences between age classes into account, we compare flock compositions observed in the field against randomized flock-compositions based on the pool of available individuals derived from the field data. During both the early, the adult-dominated, and later, the juvenile-dominated, part of the season, age classes segregate. Applied to other shorebird species, our method could be used in a comparative sense to evaluate the potential for social learning of migration routes.},

abstract = {We evaluated the potential use of stable isotopes to establish linkages between the wintering grounds and the breeding grounds of the Pectoral Sandpiper ( Calidris melanotos ), the White-rumped Sandpiper ( Calidris fuscicollis ), the Baird's Sandpiper ( Calidris bairdii ), and other Neotropical migratory shorebird species ( e.g. , Tringa spp.). These species molt their flight feathers on the wintering grounds and hence their flight feathers carry chemical signatures that are characteristic of their winter habitat. The objective of our pilot study was to assess the feasibility of identifying the winter origin of individual birds by: (1) collecting shorebird flight feathers from several widely separated Argentine sites and analyzing these for a suite of stable isotopes; and (2) analyzing the deuterium and 18 O isotope data that were available from precipitation measurement stations in Argentina. Isotopic ratios (delta 13 C, delta 15 N and delta 34 S) of flight feathers were significantly different among three widely separated sites in Argentina during January 2001. In terms of relative importance in separating the sites, delta 34 S was most important, followed by delta 15 N, and then delta 13 C. In the complete discriminant analysis, the classification function correctly predicted group membership in 85{\%} of the cases (jackknifed classification matrix). In a stepwise analysis delta 13 C was dropped from the solution, and site membership was correctly predicted in 92{\%} of cases (jackknifed matrix). Analysis of precipitation data showed that both deltaD and delta 18 O were significantly related to both latitude and longitude on a countrywide scale ( p {\textless} 0.001). Other variables, month , altitude , explained little additional variation in these isotope ratios. Several issues were identified that will likely constrain the degree of accuracy one can expect in predicting the geographic origin of birds from Argentina. There was unexplained variation in isotope ratios within and among the different wing feathers from individual birds. Such variation may indicate that birds are not faithful to a local site during their winter stay in Argentina. There was significant interannual variation in the deltaD and delta 18 O of precipitation. Hence, specific locations may not have a constant signature for some isotopes. Moreover, the fractionation that occurs in wetlands due to evaporation significantly skews local deltaD and delta 18 O values, which may undermine the strong large-scale gradients seen in the precipitation data. We are continuing the research with universities in Argentina with a focus on expanding the breadth of feather collection and attempting to resolve the identified issues.},

abstract = {1. Experiments testing predictions of optimal migration theory so far have concentrated on time and energy as the expenses that birds strive to minimize during migration. Taking advantage of the high variation in numbers of migrating raptors over the island of Helgoland, a field experiment with northern wheatears Oenanthe oenanthe was carried out whereby special attention was paid to predation risk as a possible factor in the organ- ization of migration. 2. Remote weighing of colour-marked birds supplied with ad libitum food revealed a positive correlation between departure fuel load and fuel deposition rate (FDR), an indication that wheatears during autumn migration behave like time-minimizers, which expect global variation of FDR. 3. Predation risk was measured as the rate of raptors flying over. This danger from the environment did not directly affect the departure decision of wheatears, but their FDR was negatively correlated with predation risk. Thus, predation risk influenced the stopover decision via FDR, because time-minimizers are said to skip stopover sites with low FDR when better refuelling conditions may be expected elsewhere along the migration route. 4. Departure fuel load was independent of the cost–benefit relation of predation risk and FDR, a confirmation that wheatears do not directly minimize predation risk during migration.},

abstract = {The link between individual habitat selection decisions (i.e., mechanism) and the resulting population distributions of dispersing organisms (i.e., outcome) has been little-studied in behavioural ecology. Here we consider density-dependent habitat (i.e., host) selection for an energy- and time-limited forager: the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins). We present a dynamic state variable model of individual beetle host selection behaviour, based on an individual's energy state. Field data are incorporated into model parameterization which allows us to determine the effects of host availability (with respect to host size, quality, and vigour) on individuals' decisions. Beetles choose larger trees with thicker phloem across a larger proportion of the state-space than smaller trees with thinner phloem, but accept lower quality trees more readily at low energy- and time-states. In addition, beetles make habitat selection decisions based on host availability, conspecific attack densities, and beetle distributions within a forest stand. This model provides a framework for the development of a spatial game model to examine the implications of these results for attack dynamics of beetle populations. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper describes an individual-based model, MORPH, that has been designed to predict the effect of environmental change on foraging animal populations. The key assumptions of MORPH are that individuals within populations behave in order to maximise their perceived fitness, but that perceived fitness may not always be positively related to the actual chances of survival and reproduction. MORPH has been parameterised for coastal birds on several European sites and predicted the effect of environmental change, caused by factors such as habitat loss, disturbance from humans and sea-level rise, on the survival and body condition of these species. However, MORPH contains a basic framework to describe animal physiology and foraging behaviour, and the distribution and abundance of the resources required by these animals. Therefore, MORPH is not restricted to coastal birds, and is potentially applicable to a wider range of systems. To be applied to a forager system, MORPH requires parameters describing (i) the distribution of the food supply and how food quality and abundance changes through time; (ii) the rate at which foragers consume food given the abundance of food and competitors; (iii) the amount of food the forager must consume each day to survive; (iv) the distribution and seasonal changes in other factors which influence the foraging behaviour and survival of foragers. The purpose of this paper is to (i) describe MORPH, (ii) give examples of its application, (iii) describe the types of systems to which MORPH can be applied, and (iv) publish its source code and a user guide.},

abstract = {The successful use of stable isotopes to track migratory animals between different seasons of the annual cycle depends, in part, on the turnover rate of isotopes in sample tissue. We examined whether stable-carbon isotopes in the blood of a long-distance migratory bird, the American redstart Setophaga ruticilla, sampled upon arrival to the temperate breeding grounds could be used to track the quality of habitat used the previous season on the tropical wintering grounds. Stable-carbon isotopes in red-blood cells sampled upon arrival (delta(13)C(RBC)) were significantly less negative relative to: 1) plasma sampled upon arrival from the same individuals, 2) red-blood cells of redstarts recaptured more than a month later on the breeding grounds, and 3) nestling feathers grown at the same breeding location. delta(13)C(RBC) was also significantly different between sexes, consistent with findings from the wintering grounds where sex-biased habitat use is known to occur. Although individuals likely integrate some isotopic signatures during migration, we provide evidence that cellular blood can be used to track the relative habitat use of migratory birds during the wintering period. Nondestructive methods of sampling stable-isotopes, such as this, are particularly useful because it provides a technique for tracking the patterns of habitat use and/or geographic location of migratory animals. Such approaches allow researchers to understand how events throughout the annual cycle interact to influence population dynamics},

Most birds fed in large flocks in early morning, roosted at mid-day, and resumed feeding in late afternoon-early evening. Flamingos rarely flew, except when disturbed. Adults in our study stepped at the same rates while feeding as did Chilean Flamingos (P. chilensis) feeding in the Chilean and Bolivian Andes. Paired observations of birds within mixed-age flocks revealed that adults stepped more during feeding bouts, but less between bouts, and spent more time overall with their bills in the water filter-feeding, than did juveniles. We calculate that the food-intake rate of juveniles was, at most, 82{\%} that of adults. Both adults and juveniles walk-fed and stamp-fed. Juveniles, but not adults, were twice as likely to be supplanted when stamp-feeding than when walk-feeding. Juveniles were more often involved in aggression, especially as recipients, than were adults. Aggressive encounters significantly affected the amount of time flamingos spent filter feeding.},

abstract = {Migratory wader populations face global threats, mainly related to increasing rates of habitat loss and disturbance driven by human activities. To a large extent, the long-term survival of these populations requires the conservation of networks of sites along their migratory flyways. The Tagus estuary, Portugal, is among the most important wetlands for waders in the East Atlantic Flyway. Annual winter wader counts have been carried in this wetland since 1975 and a monthly roost-monitoring programme was implemented in 2007. Wintering populations of three out of the five most abundant species, Dunlin Calidris alpina, Grey Plover Pluvialis squatarola and Redshank Tringa totanus, showed significant population declines over the past three decades, which are most likely due to the loss and degradation of roost sites as a result of increasing human activity. The situation is unlikely to improve, as a high proportion of the wintering waders use roost sites that are situated in highly urbanised areas with no legal protection. The use of different roost sites by waders is highly variable both temporally and spatially, thus emphasizing the need for a network of good quality roost sites. Additionally, during migration, 60-80{\%} of all the waders of the Tagus estuary concentrate at a single refuge, thus increasing the risk for wader populations during these periods.},

abstract = {Human communities often discharge wastewaters into estuaries, influencing their organic and pollutant loading, benthic community and trophic structure. The implementation of the Water Framework Directive has encouraged the treatment of wastewater discharges across European estuaries, but the implications for invertebrate and waterbird communities are poorly understood. We explore the effects of untreated sewage discharges on the distribution and abundance of foraging black-tailed godwits Limosa limosa and their main benthic prey (bivalves and polychaetes) on the Tejo estuary in Portugal, a major European Special Protection Area with ongoing wastewater improvements. Patches of mudflat in close proximity to sewage streams (o30m) can support polychaete densities and biomass that are an order of magnitude higher than more distant sites (470 m), and godwits foraging in these areas can attain the highest intake rates recorded for the estuary. However, high intake rates can also be attained on bivalve prey, and bivalve biomass and density increase slightly with distance from sewage streams. As the organic input from sewage outfalls influences invertebrate abundance and godwit foraging rates over relatively small areas, the ongoing implementation of a sewage treatment network on the Tejo estuary seems likely to have only a limited impact on the wintering godwit population. The localized effect of untreated sewage discharges on benthic communities suggests that the implications for predatory birds are relatively minor where alternative prey are available, but may be more severe in locations with more depauperate, polychaete-dominated invertebrate communities.},

abstract = {Anthropogenically induced changes to estuaries, including shifts from seagrass to macroalgae-dominated habitats, have led to concerns about the ability of estuaries to support fish and invertebrates. To assess differences in habitat quality of seagrass and macroalgae, we examined faunal community structure and consumer carbon assimilation in adjacent areas of seagrass, macroalgae, and bare sediments in Sage Lot Pond, Waquoit Bay, MA. Vegetation was an important factor controlling abundances, and both seagrass and macroalgae provided suitable habitat for a range of benthic fauna. Differences in consumption and assimilation of carbon of seagrass and macroalgal origin were demonstrated by shifts in $\delta$13C values of consumers between the seagrass meadow and adjacent macroalgal mats. Overall, consumers generally reflected incorporation of carbon from the dominant producers in the habitat where they were collected although macroalgae was an important carbon source for organisms in this study. These results revealed differences in carbon flow from producers to consumers across very small spatial scales ({\textless}10 m) within an estuary. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Although stopover habitats are used by many species as refuelling stations during migration and can be critical for survival and successful reproduction, they are rarely incorporated in year-round population models and conservation strategies. We incorporate stopover habitat into a density-dependent population model and then use this model to examine how optimizing one-time land purchase strategies for a migratory population is influenced by variation in the quality and the strength of density-dependence in a stopover habitat used for both fall and spring migration. As the strength of the density-dependence in the stopover habitat increases, the optimal amount of stopover habitat purchased increases while the amount of habitat during the stationary periods of the annual cycle (breeding and wintering) decreases. Any change in the cost of purchasing stopover habitat affects investment strategies in all three periods of the annual cycle. When the quality of the stopover habitat is high, the optimal strategy is to invest in low-quality habitat during breeding and wintering and when the stopover habitat quality is low, the optimal strategy switches to investing in high-quality habitat during the stationary periods. We apply this model to a threatened warbler population and demonstrate how purchase decisions to conserve stopover habitat that are not coordinated with conservation actions on the breeding and wintering grounds can potentially result in a lower population carrying-capacity compared to considering habitat in all three periods of the annual cycle simultaneously. Our model provides potential guidelines for developing conservation strategies for animals that rely on refueling habitats between the stationary breeding and non-breeding periods of the migratory cycle.},

abstract = {Little is known about the effects of waterbirds on benthic macroinvertebrates in nontidal habitats. We conducted 4 waterbird-exclusion experiments in a transformed marshland in Donana Natural Park (southwestern Spain) and compared benthic macroinvertebrates in 3 x 3-m control (no exclusion) and test plots from which Greater Flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber or all waterbirds were excluded. The 4 experimental periods coincided with the waterbird breeding season (summer), postbreeding period (autumn), wintering period (winter), and pre- and early breeding season (spring). Densities of waterbirds were relatively low compared to densities reported in other studies, but we found strong effects of excluding flamingos and waterfowl on the structure of the benthic community in autumn, winter, and spring. In winter, numbers of polychaetes and chironomids were nearly 2x higher in exclusion than in control plots. The difference in macroinvertebrate biomass among treatments was strongest in winter when benthic dry mass was similar to 2x higher in flamingo exclosures than in control plots and similar to 2x higher in all-bird exclosures than in flamingo exclosures. Macroinvertebrate richness was 15{\%} lower in control than in all-bird exclosures in winter and 25{\%} lower in control than in all-bird exclosures in spring. Our results suggest that benthic macroinvertebrate communities in this wetland are affected more by predation, bioturbation, and waterbird herbivory than by competition. These findings suggest that waterfowl and the increasing population of flamingos are of great importance in structuring shallow lakes in the Mediterranean region.},

abstract = {The distance at which animals move away from approaching threats (often quantified as flight-initiation distance [FID], or flush distance) has been used by behavioral ecologists to understand the economics of antipredator behavior. Wildlife managers often use FID when seeking to develop set-back distances to reduce human impacts on wildlife. Economic models of escape behavior predict that escape decisions will be dynamic and will be influenced by both the costs and benefits of remaining. In contrast, wildlife managers often aim to generate a single set-back distance for each species. While a number of factors are acknowledged to influence FID, the starting distance between the observer and the animal is typically ignored in FID studies. For 64 of 68 species of Australian birds, I found a significant positive relationship between starting distance and FID. This demonstrates that, as predicted by economic models, species generally assess risk dynamically and flush at a greater distance as starting distances increase. My finding is consistent with the idea that animals accrue an attentional cost for continued monitoring of an approaching predator. Researchers or managers aiming to quantify human impact using FID should use starting distance as a covariate.},

abstract = {For birds, unpredictable environments during the energetically stressful times of moulting and breeding are expected to have negative fitness effects. Detecting those effects however, might be difficult if individuals modulate their physiology and/or behaviours in ways to minimize short-term fitness costs. Corticosterone in feathers (CORTf) is thought to provide information on total baseline and stress-induced CORT levels at moulting and is an integrated measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity during the time feathers are grown. We predicted that CORTf levels in northern common eider females would relate to subsequent body condition, reproductive success and survival, in a population of eiders nesting in the eastern Canadian Arctic during a capricious period marked by annual avian cholera outbreaks. We collected CORTf data from feathers grown during previous moult in autumn and data on phenology of subsequent reproduction and survival for 242 eider females over 5 years. Using path analyses, we detected a direct relationship between CORTf and arrival date and body condition the following year. CORTf also had negative indirect relationships with both eider reproductive success and survival of eiders during an avian cholera outbreak. This indirect effect was dramatic with a reduction of approximately 30{\%} in subsequent survival of eiders during an avian cholera outbreak when mean CORTf increased by 1 standard deviation. This study highlights the importance of events or processes occurring during moult on subsequent expression of life-history traits and relation to individual fitness, and shows that information from non-destructive sampling of individuals can track carry-over effects across seasons.},

abstract = {Sandpipers of the genus Calidris tend to have similar body shapes and use narrow, tubular bills to feed on invertebrates in aquatic habitats over an extensive migratory range. Highly plastic foraging behaviours have been displayed but the associations between diet and feeding mechanics are less well understood. Here, scanning electron microscopy was used to relate the ultrastructure of the bills and tongues of two sympatric congeners, western sandpiper (C. mauri) and dunlin (C. alpina), to function and elucidate the sensory and mechanical basis to feeding. The morphology of the relatively larger, more robust bill of the dunlin suggests specialization for probing although both species are known to feed on epifaunal and infaunal prey. In general, external and internal bill features appear similar for the congeners and the microstructure of taste bud and salivary gland complexes in their mouth cavities correspond to descriptions for other birds. However, the tongues of the two species are remarkable for their distinctive micro-structural details as well as copious mucus and extraneous material. In particular, each species has unique tongue papillae, and the keratinized lateral spines along the edges and at the tips of the western sandpiper tongue are markedly longer and denser than for those of the dunlin. Based on the unique features of the tongues and associated observations, inter-species differences in foraging performance can be inferred. Further, evidence suggests that the western sandpiper, and, to a lesser extent, the dunlin, deposit feed on surficial biofilm materials, as opposed to incidentally imbibing such materials while targeting epifaunal prey. Commensurate with the evidence, a novel functional and mechanistic case for unfiltered biofilm grazing in birds is proposed.},

abstract = {Harvesting green crabs Carcinus maenas for bait is a popular fishery in south-west UK estuaries that are important habitats for shorebirds. The fishery involves laying roof tiles or PVC guttering into sediments; crabs seeking refuge bury beneath the tiles and are collected by fishers during low tide. By observing foraging birds in tiled and non-tiled sites the general model that this fishery modified shorebird diversity, distribution, and behaviour was tested. No evidence was found for a relationship between shorebird species richness, abundance or assemblage composition and the presence of tiles. To measure distributional and behavioural changes of shorebirds to crab-tiles, the focus was on two shorebird species: curlew Numenius arquata and redshank Tringa totanus. The crab-tiles affected the shorebird distribution and feeding patterns but this was dependent on species, time, and scale of observation. Redshank spent more time next to tiles than away and dedicated similar feeding effort between treatments. Curlew did not spend proportionally more time next to tiles but did spend more time feeding when they were next to tiles than away from tiles. Curlew and redshank spent proportionally more time probing than pecking when they were next to crab-tiles, but overall spent similar times exhibiting the two feeding behaviours compared with conspecifics in a non-tiled site, although this was dependent on time. It is suggested that crab-tiles may influence the spatial distribution of potential prey, thereby aggregating the birds and relieving predation pressure elsewhere. As both species (curlew and redshank) were observed standing not feeding, i.e. resting or preening, when next to tiles we also suggest that the structure created by the tiles provides some shelter to reduce negative effects of wind on thermoregulation.

abstract = {Behavioural variation within a species is usually explained as the consequence of individual variation in physiology. However, new evidence suggests that the arrow of causality may well be in the reverse direction: behaviours such as diet preferences cause the differences in physiological and morphological traits.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nRecently, diet preferences were proposed to underlie consistent differences in digestive organ mass and movement patterns (patch residence times) in red knots (Calidris canutus islandica). Red knots are molluscivorous and migrant shorebirds for which the size of the muscular stomach (gizzard) is critical for the food processing rate.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nIn this study, red knots (C. c. canutus, n = 46) were caught at Banc d'Arguin, an intertidal flat ecosystem in Mauritania, and released with radio-tags after the measurement of gizzard mass. Using a novel tracking system (time-of-arrival), patch residence times were measured over a period of three weeks. Whether or not gizzard mass determined patch residence times was tested experimentally by offering 12 of the 46 tagged red knots soft diets prior to release; this reduced an individual's gizzard mass by 20–60{\%}. To validate whether the observed range of patch residence times would be expected from individual diet preferences, we simulated patch residence times as a function of diet preferences via a simple departure rule.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nConsistent with previous empirical studies, patch residence times in the field were positively correlated with gizzard mass. The slope of this correlation, as well as the observed range of patch residence times, was in accordance with the simulated values. The 12 birds with reduced gizzard masses did not decrease patch residence times in response to the reduction in gizzard mass.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThese findings suggest that diet preferences can indeed cause the observed among-individual variation in gizzard mass and patch residence times. We discuss how early diet experiences can have cascading effects on the individual expression of both behavioural and physiomorphic traits. This emphasizes that to understand the ecological consequences of individual differences, knowledge of the environment during development is required.},

abstract = {Twenty-four juvenile Steller's Sea Eagles Haliaeetus pelagicus were tracked via satellite from natal areas in Magadan, Kabarovsk, Amur, Sakhalin and Kamchatka. Nestling dispersal occurred between 9 September and 6 December (n = 24), mostly 14 September-21 October, and did not differ among regions or years. Most eagles made stopovers of 4-28 days during migration. Migration occurred 9 September-18 January, mostly along previously described routes, taking 4-116 days to complete (n = 18). Eagles averaged 47.8 km/day excluding stopovers; 22.9 km/day including stopovers. The mean degrees of latitude spanned during migration was: Kamchatka, 2.1; Magadan, 11.6; Amur, 7.3; and Sakhalin, 1.1. Eagle winter range sizes varied. Eagles concentrated in 1-3 subareas within overall winter ranges. The mean size of the first wintering subareas was 274 km(2), the second 529 km(2) , and the third 1181 km(2). Second wintering areas were south of first wintering areas. Spring migration started between 2 February and 31 March. Two eagles from Magadan were tracked onto summering grounds, well south of their natal areas. Both had early and late summering areas. One bird was followed for 25 months. It initiated its second autumn migration in the first half of October and arrived on its wintering grounds on 26 December. The second autumn migration covered 1839 km (20.9-22.4 km/day). Unlike its first winter when it used two subareas, this bird used only one subarea in 1998-99, but this was located near wintering areas used in 1997-98. It left its wintering ground between 13 April and 13 May, and arrived on its summering grounds between 7 June and 8 July. Unlike most satellite radiotracking studies, data are presented from a relatively large number of birds from across their breeding range, including new information on eagle movements on the wintering grounds and during the second year.},

abstract = {Phenotypic characteristics of animals can change independently from changes in the genetic code. These plastic phenotypic responses are important for population persistence in changing environments. Plasticity can be induced during early development, with persistent effects on adult phenotypes, and it can occur reversibly throughout life (acclimation). These manifestations of plasticity have been viewed as separate processes. Here we argue that developmental conditions not only change mean trait values but also modify the capacity for acclimation. Acclimation counteracts the potentially negative effects of phenotype-environment mismatches resulting from epigenetic modifications during early development. Developmental plasticity is therefore also beneficial when environmental conditions change within generations. Hence, the evolution of reversible acclimation can no longer be viewed as independent from developmental processes. Phenotypic plasticity increases resilience to environmental change. Developmental conditions determine capacity for reversible acclimation later in life.This mechanistic link between development and acclimation means that the costs of plasticity are reduced.Evolutionary models can incorporate this link explicitly to improve predictions.},

abstract = {1. Toward understanding the geography of omnivory, we tested three hypotheses that predict the proportion of animal tissue consumed: The Sodium Limitation Hypothesis predicts that omnivores increase animal consumption in Na-poor environments because Na bioaccumulates from plants to predators; thus, heterotrophs are Na-rich sources. The Nitrogen Limitation and Habitat Productivity Hypotheses use the same logic to predict more animal consumption in N-poor and productive environments respectively. 2. Omnivory is a common trophic strategy, but what determines the balance of plant and animal tissue omnivores consume is relatively unexplored. Most of what we know comes from single populations at local scales. Here we quantitatively test these three hypotheses at a large geographic scale and across 20 species of omnivorous ants. 3. We tested each hypothesis using N stable isotopes ($\delta$15N) to quantify the degree of carnivory in ant populations in 20 forests that span 12° latitude from Georgia to Maine, USA. We used the difference in $\delta$15N between 20 ant conspecifics in 10 genera between two two paired forests (10 pairs of 20 forests) that consisted of a coastal and inland forests on the same latitude to determine if the proportion of animal tissue consumed could be predicted based on Na, N or NPP. 4. Sodium gradients accounted for 18{\%} of the variation in $\delta$15N, 45{\%} if one outlier ant species was omitted. In contrast, the Nitrogen Limitation and Habitat Productivity Hypotheses, which predict more animal consumption in N-poor and more productive environments respectively, failed to vary with $\delta$15N. 5. Our results reveal a geography of omnivory driven in part by access to Na.},

@article{Harts2016,
abstract = {For migratory species, the timing of arrival at breeding grounds is an important determinant of fitness. Too early arrival at the breeding ground is associated with various costs, and we focus on one understudied cost: that migrants can experience a higher risk of predation if arriving earlier than the bulk of the breeding population. We show, using both a semi-analytic and simulation model, that predation can select for later arrival. This is because of safety in numbers: predation risk becomes diluted if many other individuals, either con- or heterospecific, are already residing in the area. Predation risk dilution can also select for more synchronous arrival because deviating from the current population-wide norm to earlier or later dates leads to higher predation risk or to failures in territory acquisition, respectively. The fact that selection for high arrival synchrony can in some cases be more important than selection for a specific date (early or late) within the season is an example of an ‘evolutionary priority effect': whichever strategy – in this case a particular arrival time – becomes established in a population can remain stable over long periods of time; there are many possible equilibria (multiple stable states) which the population can remain at. Mixed arrival strategies are also possible under some circumstances.},

abstract = {Organisms in a seasonal environment often schedule activities in a regular way over the year. If we assume that such annual routines have been shaped by natural selection then life-history theory should provide a basis for explaining them. We argue that many life-history trade-offs are mediated by underlying physiological variables that act on various time scales. The dynamics of these variables often preclude considering one period of the year in isolation. In order to capture the essence of annual routines, and many life-history traits, a detailed model of changes in physiological state over the annual cycle is required. We outline a modelling approach based on suitable physiological and ecological state variables that can capture this underlying biology, and describe how models based on this approach can be used to generate a range of insights and predictions.},

abstract = {Many shorebird populations throughout North America are thought to be declining, with potential causes attributed to habitat loss and fragmentation, reduced prey availability, increased predation, human disturbance, and increased exposure to environmental pollutants. Shorebirds may be particularly vulnerable to contaminant exposure throughout their life cycle, as they forage primarily on invertebrates in wetlands, where many contaminants accumulate disproportionately in the sediments. Therefore, it is important to document and monitor shorebird populations thought to be at risk and assess the role that environmental contaminants may have on population declines. To investigate potential threats and provide baseline data on shorebird contaminant levels in Alaskan shorebirds, contaminant concentrations were evaluated in shorebird eggs from 16 species residing in seven geographic distinct regions of Alaska. Similar to previous studies, low levels of most inorganic and organic contaminants were found, although concentrations of several inorganic and organic contaminants were higher than those of previous studies. For example, elevated strontium levels were observed in several species, especially black oystercatcher (Haematopus bachmani) sampled in Prince William Sound, Alaska. Additionally, contaminant concentrations varied among species, with significantly higher concentrations of inorganic contaminants found in eggs of pectoral sandpiper (Calidris melanotos), semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla), black oystercatcher, and bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica). Similarly, significantly higher concentrations of some organic contaminants were found in the eggs of American golden plover (Pluvialis dominica), black-bellied plover (Pluvialis squatarola), pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva), bar-tailed godwit, and semipalmated sandpiper. Despite these elevated levels, current concentrations of contaminants in shorebird eggs suggest that breeding environments are relatively free of most contaminants and that contaminant concentrations are below levels (except potentially strontium) that would likely affect the survival of individuals and consequently regulate the species at the population level.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

Significant declines were recorded most consistently for Least Sandpiper (Calidris minutilla), Semipalmated Sandpiper (C. pusilla), and Short-billed Dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus), and decreases for Red Knot (C. canutus) and Black-bellied Plover (Pluvialis squatarola) approached statistical significance in some analyses. Population trends were not constant but varied consistently across species during different phases of the study period. Declines occurred ih most of the 13 species analyzed during the latter part of the 1970s, followed by increases during the first half of the 1980s, with a less marked tendency towards declines in recent years. A series of cold summers on the breeding grounds during the 1970s may have led to the observed population declines at that time. Statistical power analysis indicated that population changes of 2-5{\%} should be detected at 80{\%} power for the number of sites and years of coverage for which data were available.},

abstract = {For many taxa, ranges are shifting toward the poles and the timing of seasonal reproduction is advancing in response to climate change. For migratory birds, changes such as these could produce particularly strong impacts because of their potential to affect migratory timing and distance. Due to the relatively complex life histories of migratory species, however, it is difficult to intuit exactly what these impacts will be. Here, we develop a general population model for a long-distance migrant, introducing a framework for understanding the potential implications of changes in both phenology and migratory distance for bird abundances. We find that population sizes may increase with either shorter or longer migratory distances, depending on the nature of any concurrent phenological changes. This interaction between timing and distance suggests a need to consider multiple potential responses to climate change simultaneously in order to understand the overall impact of climate change on migratory populations. Our results reveal a degree of variability in the qualitative nature of this phenology-distance interaction, suggesting a possible explanation for observed variation in how migratory birds have already responded to climate change.},

We experimentally tested the hypothesis that siphon nippers facilitate predation on the entire bivalve (by shorebirds, for example) by inducing a decrease in burying depth. Three experiments in May and in September, during which likely siphon nippers (juvenile plaice P. platessa) were allowed to feed on M. balthica siphons, demonstrated that the bivalves indeed lost siphon mass and came closer to the surface. However, the strength of the burying response and the speed of recovery of siphons after nipping varied greatly between experiments, partly as a consequence of body condition-related differences in initial burying depth. Our experimental study confirms that siphon nippers can enhance the availability of bivalve prey to probing predators, and will thus facilitate avian predation on intertidal flats.},

Peregrine Falcons ( Falco peregrinus ) were locally reintroduced and increased from one active nest site in 1989 to 27 in 2010, which coincided with a decline of sandpipers roosting at Mary's Point from an annual mean of 161,000 in 1976-1982 to 15,000 or less during this study. Mean roosting time of flocks was 33 min (range = 10 to 40 min; N = 6). Sandpipers returned to the beach 1 h:36 min after high-tide (range = 1 h:10 to 2 h:13 min; N = 5), but were soon flushed again by falcons. On ten of 19 days, during part of the high-tide period, flocks of sandpipers remained in flight over the ocean. Termed Over-Ocean Flocking (OOF), this behavior was seen on days when spring tides inundated all beach habitat, and also at lower tides, which supports the hypothesis that OOF is an antipredator strategy intended to avoid surprise attacks by falcons near the shore. Raptors sighted during 128 hours afield included 226 Peregrines, 20 Merlins ( Falco columbarius ) and two Sharp-shinned Hawks ( Accipiter striatus). At 1.0-3.2 Peregrine sightings/h -1 (mean 1.8) the level of disturbance is high and supports the hypothesis that the decline in roosting sandpipers at Mary's Point is linked to predation danger.},

abstract = {Millions of birds migrate to and from the Arctic each year, but rapid climate change in the High North could strongly affect where species are able to breed, disrupting migratory connections globally. We modelled the climatically suitable breeding conditions of 24 Arctic specialist shorebirds and projected them to 2070 and to the mid-Holocene climatic optimum, the world's last major warming event {\~{}}6000 years ago. We show that climatically suitable breeding conditions could shift, contract and decline over the next 70 years, with 66–83{\%} of species losing the majority of currently suitable area. This exceeds, in rate and magnitude, the impact of the mid-Holocene climatic optimum. Suitable climatic conditions are predicted to decline acutely in the most species rich region, Beringia (western Alaska and eastern Russia), and become concentrated in the Eurasian and Canadian Arctic islands. These predicted spatial shifts of breeding grounds could affect the species composition of the world's major flyways. Encouragingly, protected area coverage of current and future climatically suitable breeding conditions generally meets target levels; however, there is a lack of protected areas within the Canadian Arctic where resource exploitation is a growing threat. Given that already there are rapid declines of many populations of Arctic migratory birds, our results emphasize the urgency of mitigating climate change and protecting Arctic biodiversity.},

By estimating population sizes of shorebirds in the U.S. portion of the prairie pothole landscape in central North America, where most migrating shorebirds exhibit a highly dispersed spatial pattern, we determined that the region may play a vital role in the conservation of shorebirds. During northward and southward migration, 7.3 million shorebirds (95{\%} CI: 4.3-10.3 million) and 3.9 million shorebirds (95{\%} CI: 1.7-6.0 million) stopped to rest and refuel in the study area; inclusion of locally breeding species increases the estimates by 0.1 million and 0.07 million shorebirds, respectively. Seven species of calidridine sandpipers, including Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla), White-rumped Sandpipers (C. fuscicollis), and Stilt Sandpipers (C. himantopus), constituted 50{\%} of northbound migrants in our study area. We present an approach to population estimation and monitoring, based on stratified random selection of townships as sample units, that is well suited to 11 migratory shorebird species. For extensive and dynamic wetland systems, we strongly caution against a monitoring program based solely on repeated counts of known stopover sites with historically high numbers of shorebirds. We recommend refinements in methodology to address sample-size requirements and potential sources of bias so that our approach may form the basis of a rigorous migration monitoring program in this and other prairie wetland regions.},

abstract = {Previous studies have documented advancement in clutch initiation dates (CIDs) in response to climate change, most notably for temperate-breeding passerines. Despite accelerated climate change in the Arctic, few studies have examined nest phenology shifts in arctic breeding species. We investigated whether CIDs have advanced for the most abundant breeding shorebird and passerine species at a long-term monitoring site in arctic Alaska. We pooled data from three additional nearby sites to determine the explanatory power of snow melt and ecological variables (predator abundance, green-up) on changes in breeding phenology. As predicted, all species (semipalmated sandpiper, Calidris pusilla, pectoral sandpiper, Calidris melanotos, red-necked phalarope, Phalaropus lobatus, red phalarope, Phalaropus fulicarius, Lapland longspur, Calcarius lapponicus) exhibited advanced CIDs ranging from 0.40 to 0.80 days/year over 9 years. Timing of snow melt was the most important variable in explaining clutch initiation advancement (“climate/snow hypothesis”) for four of the five species, while green-up was a much less important explanatory factor. We found no evidence that high predator abundances led to earlier laying dates (“predator/re-nest hypothesis”). Our results support previous arctic studies in that climate change in the cryosphere will have a strong impact on nesting phenology although factors explaining changes in nest phenology are not necessarily uniform across the entire Arctic. Our results suggest some arctic-breeding shorebird and passerine species are altering their breeding phenology to initiate nesting earlier enabling them to, at least temporarily, avoid the negative consequences of a trophic mismatch.},

abstract = {1. Attempts to identify the prevalence and nature of density dependence in ecological populations have often used statistical analysis of ecological time-series of population counts. Such time-series are also being used increasingly to parameterize models that may be used in population management. 2. If time-series contain measurement errors, tests that rely on detecting a negative relationship between log population change and population size are biased and prone to spuriously detecting density dependence (Type I error). This is because the measurement error in density for a given year appears in the corresponding change in population density, with equal magnitude but opposite sign. 3. This effect introduces bias that may invalidate comparisons of ecological data with density-independent time-series. Unless census error can be accounted for, time-series may appear to show strongly density-dependent dynamics, even though the density-dependent signal may in reality be weak or absent. 4. We distinguish two forms of measurement error, both of which have serious consequences for detecting density dependence. 5. First, estimates of population density are based rarely on exact counts, but on samples. Hence there exists sampling error, with the level of error depending on the method employed and the number of replicates on which the population estimate is based. 6. Secondly, the group of organisms measured is often not a truly self-contained population, but part of a wider ecological population, defined in terms of location or behaviour. Consequently, the subpopulation studied may effectively be a sample of the population and spurious density dependence may be detected in the dynamics of a single subpopulation. In this case, density dependence is detected erroneously, even if numbers within the subpopulation are censused without measurement error. 7. In order to illustrate how process variation and measurement error may be distinguished we review data sets (counts of numbers of birds by single observers) for which both census error and long-term variance in population density can be estimated. 8. Tests for density dependence need to obviate the problem that measured population sizes are typically estimates rather than exact counts. It is possible that in some cases it may be possible to test for density dependence in the presence of unknown levels of census error, for example by uncovering nonlinearities in the density response. However, it seems likely that these may lack power compared with analyses that are able to explicitly include census error and we review some recently developed methods.},

@article{Erni2002a,
abstract = {Long-distance bird migration consists of a series of stopovers (for refuelling) and flights, with flights taking little time compared to stopovers. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that birds minimize the total time taken for migration through efficient stopover behaviour. Current optimality models for stopover include (1) the fixed expectation rule and (2) the global update rule. These rules maximize the speed of migration by determining the optimal departure fuel load for a given fuel deposition rate. We were interested in simple behavioural rules approaching the stopover behaviour of real birds and how these rules compare to the time minimizing models above with respect to the total time taken for migration. The simple strategies were to stay at a site (1) until a fixed fuel load was reached or (2) for a constant number of days. We simulated migration of small nocturnal passerine birds across an environment of continuously distributed but variable fuel deposition rates, and investigated the influence of different stopover strategies on the duration of migration. Staying for a constant number of days at each stopover site, irrespective of the fuel deposition rate, resulted in only slightly longer than minimum values for migration duration. Additionally, the constant stopover duration, e.g. 10 days, may change by a day or two (per stopover) without having a large effect on total migration duration. There is therefore a possibility that real birds may be close to optimal migration speed without the need for very complex behaviour. When assessing the sensitivity of migration duration to factors other than stopover duration, we found that flight costs, search and settling time, mean fuel deposition rate and the accuracy in the choice of flight direction were the factors with the largest influence. Our results suggest that migrating birds can approximate optimal stopover duration relatively easy with a simple rule, and that other factors, e.g. those above, are more relevant for travel time.},

abstract = {Background: Dispersal is a primary driver in shaping the future distribution of species in both terrestrial and marine systems. Physical transport by advection can regulate the distance travelled and rate of propagule supply to a habitat but post-settlement processes such as predation can decouple supply from recruitment. The effect of flow-mediated recruitment and predation on the recruitment success of an intertidal species, the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica was evaluated in two-replicated field experiments. Two key crab species were manipulated to test predator identity effects on oyster mortality. Findings: Recruitment was similar to 58{\%} higher in high flow compared to low flow, but predation masked those differences. Predation mortality was primarily attributed to the blue crab Callinectes sapidus, whilst the mud crab Panopeus herbstii had no effect on recruit mortality. Recruit mortality from predation was high when recruit densities were high, but when recruit density was low, predation effects were not seen. Under high recruitment (supply), predation determined maximum population size and in low flow environments, recruitment success is likely determined by a combination of recruitment and resource limitation but not predation. Conclusions: Four processes are demonstrated: (1) Increases in flow rate positively affect recruitment success; (2) In high flow (recruitment) environments, resource availability is less important than predation; (3) predation is an important source of recruit mortality, but is dependent upon recruit density; and (4) recruitment and/or resource limitation is likely a major driver of population structure and functioning, modifying the interaction between predators and prey. Simultaneous testing of flow-mediated recruitment and predation was required to differentiate between the role of each process in determining population size. Our results reinforce the importance of propagule pressure, predation and post-settlement mortality as important determinants of population growth and persistence, but demonstrate that they should not be considered mutually exclusive.},

Overall, adult females preceded adult males by 1.22 days. A novel finding was that among juveniles, which migrate approximately a month later than adults, females preceded males by similar magnitude (1.14 days). There was wide variation among years, however, and males actually preceded females in years with late hatch. We relate these findings to hypotheses for female-first southward migration in sandpipers.},

abstract = {Many shorebirds are long-distance migrants, and they depend upon widely spaced stopover sites for refueling during their annual migrations. Two competing hypotheses attempt to explain stopover duration: one predicts departure based on time minimization (time-selection hypothesis) and the other predicts departure on the basis of maximum energy gain (energy-selection hypothesis). During spring 1993, we tested these hypotheses during a mark-resight study of migrant Sanderlings (Calidris alba) at Portsmouth Island, North Carolina. We individually color-banded 204 Sanderlings and used capture-recapture methods to estimate local apparent survival during 10 five-day intervals from late April to mid-June. We found that survival rates were best modeled as a decreasing quadratic time trend; a linear time trend and period-specific survival rates received little support. We found no evidence that either body mass or a simple body condition index better explained survival rates. Our estimates of the 5-day local survival rates of Sanderlings at Portsmouth Island remained relatively high (phi(i) {\textgreater} 0.80) through late May, after which they dropped rapidly as birds left the area. The period-specific conditional resighting probability was 0.39 (SE = 0.03). Our results do not provide strong support for either the time- or energy-selection hypotheses and hint that studies of migratory behavior need to be conducted even more intensively and across much larger regions in order to better understand the underlying factors.},

abstract = {The dilution effect as an antipredation behaviour is the main theoretical reason for grouping in animals and states that all individuals in a group have an equal risk of being predated if equally spaced from each other and the predator. Stalking predators, however, increase their chance of attack success by preferentially targeting nonvigilant individuals, potentially making relative vigilance rates in a group relatively important in determining predation compared with the dilution effect. Many predators, however, attack opportunistically without stalking, when targeting of nonvigilant individuals may be less likely, so that the dilution effect will then be a relatively more important antipredation reason for grouping. We tested whether an opportunistically hunting predator, the sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, preferentially attacked vigilant or feeding prey models presented in pairs. We found that sparrowhawks attacked vigilant and feeding mounts at similar frequencies. Our results suggest that individuals should prioritize maximizing group size or individual vigilance dependent on the type of predator from which they are at risk. When the most likely predator is a stalker, individuals should aim to have the highest vigilance levels in a group, and there may be relatively little selective advantage to being in the largest group. In contrast, if the most likely predator is an opportunist, then individuals should simply aim to be in the largest group and can also spend more time foraging without compromising predation risk. For most natural systems this will mean a trade-off between the two strategies dependent on the frequency of attack of each predator type. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {Estuarine sediment flats are essential feeding areas for waders, but their exploitation is constrained by the movements of tides. In this cyclic environment the exposure period of sediment flats decreases several fold from upper to lower flats, and the moving tidal waterline briefly creates particular conditions for waders and their prey. This study attempts to determine how the exposure period and the movement of the tide line influence the use of space and food resources by waders across the sediment flats. Wader counts and observations of feeding behaviour were carried out in all phases of the tidal cycle, in plots forming a transect from upper to lower flats, thus representing a gradient of exposure periods. Pecking, prey intake, and success rates varied little along the gradient. Some species actively followed the tide line while foraging, whereas others are evenly spread over the exposed flats. Black-tailed Godwit, Dunlin and Avocet were 'tide followers', whereas Grey Plover, Redshank and Bar-tailed Godwit were 'non-followers'. Densities of 'followers' near the tide line were up to five times higher than elsewhere. Species differed markedly in the way they used space on the flats, but in general the rate of biomass acquisition (in grams of ash-free dry weight per time exposed) was much higher in lower flats. However, this preference was insufficient to counter the much longer exposure of the upper flats, so the total amount of biomass consumed on the latter was greater. Therefore, it was in these upper flats that waders fulfilled most of their energetic needs. Consequently, upper flats are of particular importance for the conservation of wader assemblages, but because they are usually closer to shore they tend to suffer the highest pressure from disturbance and land reclamation.

abstract = {Thirty-two radiomarked Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri), tagged in California and Washington, were relocated at stopover and breeding sites north and west of the Copper River Delta, Alaska. At Cook Inlet, Alaska, seven of the nine relocated birds were at Redoubt and Kachemak bays. Only 1 of the 17 birds relocated on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta had been previously detected at Cook Inlet. Detections of birds in western Alaska provide evidence that the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta is the final breeding destination for many of the birds migrating through San Francisco and other Pacific Coast areas. The Mulchatna River area, 325 km southeast of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, may support a breeding population of Western Sandpipers.},

abstract = {Ecological theory predicts that the diffuse risk cues generated by wide-ranging, active predators should induce prey behavioural responses but not major, population- or community-level consequences. We evaluated the non-consumptive effects (NCEs) of an active predator, the grey wolf (Canis lupus), by simultaneously tracking wolves and the behaviour, body fat, and pregnancy of elk (Cervus elaphus), their primary prey in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. When wolves approached within 1 km, elk increased their rates of movement, displacement and vigilance. Even in high-risk areas, however, these encounters occurred only once every 9 days. Ultimately, despite 20-fold variation in the frequency of encounters between wolves and individual elk, the risk of predation was not associated with elk body fat or pregnancy. Our findings suggest that the ecological consequences of actively hunting large carnivores, such as the wolf, are more likely transmitted by consumptive effects on prey survival than NCEs on prey behaviour.},

abstract = {We studied costs and benefits of life history shifts of water fleas (genus Daphnia) in response to infochemicals from planktivorous fish. We applied a dynamic energy budget model to investigate the resource allocation patterns underlying the observed life history shifts and their adaptive value under size selective predation in one coherent analysis. Using a published data set of life history shifts in response to fish infochemicals we show that Daphnia invests less energy in somatic growth in the fish treatment. This observation complies with theoretical predictions on optimal resource allocation. However, the observed patterns of phenotypic plasticity cannot be explained by changes in resource allocation patterns alone because our model-based analysis of the empirical data clearly identified additional bioenergetic costs in the fish treatments. Consequently, the response to fish kairomone only becomes adaptive if the intensity of size selective predation surpasses a certain critical level. We believe that this is the first study that puts resource allocation, energetic costs and adaptive value of predator induced life-history shifts - using empirical data - into one theoretical framework.},

abstract = {Intertidal areas support during the non-breeding season many wading birds Charadrii that may often take flight in response to the presence of people or of birds of prey on their intertidal feeding and roosting grounds. Disturbance can cause birds to spend energy flying away and to lose feeding time while relocating to different feeding areas, where the increased bird densities may intensify competition from interference and, if of sufficient duration, from prey depletion. Until now, there has been no method for establishing how frequently birds can be put to flight before their fitness is reduced. We show how individual-based behavioural models can establish critical thresholds for the frequency with which wading birds can be disturbed before they die of starvation. It uses oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus in the baie de Somme, France where birds were put to flight by disturbance up to 1.73 times/daylight hour. Modelling shows that the birds can be disturbed up to 1.0-1.5 times/h before their fitness is reduced in winters with good feeding conditions (abundant cockles Cerastoderma edule and mild weather) but only up to 0.2-0.5 times/h when feeding conditions are poor (scarce cockles and severe winter weather). Individual-based behavioural models enable critical disturbance thresholds to be established for the first time. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We estimated the: annual population of Western Sandpipers (Calidras mauri) and Dunlin ( Calidris alpina pacifica) stopping over on the Copper River Delta during peak spring migration 1992-1995. Our calculations required four components: total daily shorebird numbers, the daily proportion of each species, average length of stay, and the detection probability. For the 21-d period 26 April-16 May, annual population estimates for Western Sandpiper ranged from 1.2-4.1 million birds per year. Dunlin estimates for this same period ranged from 0.3-0.9 million. For both species, numbers were highest in 1993 and lowest in 1994. Power analysis determined that 15 yr of aerial surveys are needed to detect a 10{\%} decline in Western Sandpiper numbers. Based on the proportion of birds in the Pacific Flyway stopping over on the Copper River Delta, we estimated the Western Sandpiper Pacific Flyway population was {\textgreater}2.8 million in 1992 and {\textgreater}4.3 million in 1995. These data indicate that the Copper River Delta continues to support the largest spring concentration of shorebirds in the Western Hemisphere.},

abstract = {Potential prey are often exposed to multiple predators that vary in their foraging tactics and ability to detect prey. For animals that rely on crypsis to avoid predators, one solution is to alter their behaviour or appearance to maximize crypsis in ways that are specific to different types of predator. We tested whether dwarf chameleons (Bradypodion transvaalense) showed different behavioural responses, including colour change, towards multiple predators (bird and snake models) that detect and capture prey in different ways, and whether these antipredator responses varied geographically. Chameleons consistently used the same body postures (lateral compression and flipping to the opposite side of the branch) and displayed similar chromatic (colour) contrast against the natural background in response to both predator types. However, they became significantly more achromatically contrasting (brighter) in the presence of the snake compared to the bird. This relative difference in achromatic contrast towards the two types of predator was consistent among populations. There were also significant differences in both absolute achromatic and chromatic contrast among populations despite very similar light environment, background coloration and habitat structure. Our results highlight facultative crypsis as one type of flexible antipredator tactic and emphasize the importance of visual ecology in understanding prey-predator interactions.

abstract = {The behaviour literature is full of studies showing that animals in every taxon balance the probability of acquiring food with the risk of being preyed upon. While interactions between food and predators clearly operate at an individual scale, population-scale studies have tended to focus on only one factor at a time. Consequently, interactive (or 'synergistic') effects of food and predators on whole populations have only twice before been experimentally demonstrated in mammals. We conducted a 2 x 2 experiment to examine the joint effects of food supply and predator pressure on the annual reproductive success of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). Our results show that these two factors do not operate in an additive way, but instead have a synergistic effect on reproduction. Relative to controls, sparrows reared 1.1 more young when food was added and 1.3 more when predator pressure was low. When these treatments were combined 4.0 extra young were produced, almost twice as many as expected from an additive model. These results are a cause for optimism for avian conservation because they demonstrate that remedial actions, aimed at simultaneously augmenting food and reducing predators, can produce dramatic increases in reproductive success.},

In this study we looked at seasonal changes in the food supplies of shorebirds at a migratory stopover to see if dwindling food supplies here might explain early arrival from Arctic breeding grounds. For the three earliest migrants through Plymouth, Massachusetts we found substantial reductions of prey densities (7-90{\%}) during migration (July-September). Reductions in prey density were not substantial before September for a later migrant. Caging experiments showed that the reductions in density of infaunal prey were due to predation. If these reductions are sufficient to cause energetic deficits among late arrivals, then competition may be an important selective agent in shaping migratory patterns},

abstract = {Coinciding with increasing spring temperatures in Europe, many migrants have advanced their arrival or passage times over the last decades. However, some species, namely long-distance migrants, could be constrained in their arrival dates due to their largely inherited migratory behaviour and thus a likely inflexibility in their response to exogenous factors. To examine this hypothesis for pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), we tested the effects of the temperature regimes along their migration routes north of the Sahara on their arrival times in central Europe. To do so, we developed a site-independent large-scale approach based on temperature data available on the Internet. Temperature regimes along the migration routes of pied flycatchers within Europe convincingly correlate with their first arrival times. It can be concluded that the progression of spring migration in this species is strongly influenced by temperature en route. Because of the recent inconsistent climatic changes in various parts of Europe, we hypothesize that individuals migrating along different routes will be unequally affected by further climatic changes.},

abstract = {Long-distance migrations are among the wonders of the natural world, but this multitaxon review shows that the characteristics of species that undertake such movements appear to make them particularly vulnerable to detrimental impacts of climate change. Migrants are key components of biological systems in high latitude regions, where the speed and magnitude of climate change impacts are greatest. They also rely on highly productive seasonal habitats, including wet-lands and ocean upwellings that, with climate change, may become less food-rich and predictable in space and time. While migrants are adapted to adjust their behaviour with annual changes in the weather, the decoupling of climatic variables between geographically separate breeding and non-breeding grounds is beginning to result in mistimed migration. Furthermore, human land-use and activity patterns will constrain the ability of many species to modify their migratory routes and may increase the stress induced by climate change. Adapting conservation strategies for migrants in the light of climate change will require substantial shifts in site designation policies, flexibility of management strategies and the integration of forward planning for both people and wildlife. While adaptation to changes may be feasible for some terrestrial systems, wildlife in the marine ecosystem may be more dependent on the degree of climate change mitigation that is achievable.},

abstract = {Weekly counts of western Atlantic red knots (Calidris canutus rufa) at their Delaware Bay migration stopover site have suggested a major decline since the 1980s. We estimated red knot spring passage population size in the New Jersey CoastDelaware Bay region (DENJ; 2004 and 2006) and Virginia (VA; 2006 and 2007), USA, by correcting weekly aerial counts for mean daily residence probability between counts in a Monte-Carlo simulation. We used daily telemetry relocations in markresight models to estimate mean daily residence probability. Average daily residence probability was approximately 1.0 in mid-May, 0.960.97 in the week of 22 May, and 0.640.77 after May 28 in DENJ in 2004 and 2006 and in VA in 2006. Average daily residency was approximately 0.88 in VA in 2007 from 22 May to 5 June. No birds moved from VA to DENJ in 2006 and only 2 birds (5.5) moved in 2007. Stopover population sizes (±SE) in DENJ were 17,108 ± 1,322 in 2004 and 19,555 ± 831 in 2006, and in VA were 7,224 ± 389 in 2006 and 8,332 ± 718 in 2007, significantly greater than peak aerial counts. Years with similar peak counts had different residence probabilities; hence, adjustments for turnover should be used in the future to assess annual population changes. Our results suggest that VA can support a significant portion of this red knot subspecies during migration in at least some years. Managing red knots for recovery should entail improving our understanding of the use of other Atlantic Coast sites and protecting key coastal habitat from disturbance and development. {\textcopyright} The Wildlife Society.},

abstract = {Capsule Population response of breeding waders to agri-environment management varied between management options and species; implementation has been on too small a scale to reverse national population declines. Aims To test whether numbers of five breeding wader species have shown a more positive response between 1992 and 2005, at sites with appropriate agri-environment management, than at sites that have remained outside such schemes. Methods Using data from 60 pairs of farmland study areas in Scotland first surveyed in 1992/93, before agri-environment scheme (AES) implementation, and again in 2005, after scheme implementation, we tested at both site and field scales whether changes in the abundance of five breeding wader species were associated with AES management options designed to benefit these species. Results Changes in breeding wader abundance were more positive on sites in AES, especially for Northern Lapwings Vanellus vanellus and Common Redshanks Tringa totanus, even though management had not been targetted specially at breeding waders on those sites. However, AES management was associated only with modest population increase for Common Redshanks, and a reduction in the magnitude of decline for Northern Lapwings. At the field scale, there was evidence for Northern Lapwings, Common Redshanks and Common Snipe Gallinago gallinago that options which limited grazing and other agricultural activity were associated with more positive outcomes than those which also manipulated water levels. Conclusions AES management for breeding waders slowed, and in some cases reversed, breeding wader decline at field and farm scales. These benefits were from options that limited grazing and agricultural operations during the breeding season, but not those that also aimed to raise water levels. A possible explanation is that when wetland options are applied to agriculturally marginal fields, grazing reduction or abandonment, and succession to rank vegetation cover then occur over the course of 5-year agreements, with detrimental effects for breeding waders. Verification arrangements need to be robust enough to guard against this. Levels of agri-environment provision in 2005 were too limited and too poorly targeted at remaining key areas for breeding waders to be able to halt or reverse national population declines.},

abstract = {1. Prey aggregations, such as fish schools, attract numerous predators. This typically leads to the formation of multispecific groups of predators. These aggregations can be seen both as a place of increased competition and as a place of possible facilitation between predators. Con- sequently, the functional role of such predator–prey aggregation is uncertain, and its effect on individual feeding success is virtually unknown. 2. Using underwater film footage of different predators feeding on fish schools during the sardine run in South Africa, we directly measured the in situ feeding success of individual Cape gannets Morus capensis in different foraging situations. 3. We determined the types of Cape gannet attacks (direct plunge dive or plunge dive followed by underwater pursuit) and we measured the occurrences and timing of attacks from the different species (mostly Cape gannets and long-beaked common dolphins Delphinus capensis). We also estimated the size of the targeted fish schools. These observations were complemented with a simulation model to evaluate the cumulative effect of successive predator attacks on the prey aggregation structure. 4. The probability to capture a fish in one feeding attempt by Cape gannets averaged 0?28. It was lower when gannets engaged in underwater prey pursuit after the plunge com- pared to direct plunge (0?13 vs. 0?36). We found no effect of the number of prey on gan- nets' feeding success. However, the timing and frequency of attacks influenced strongly and positively the feeding success of individuals. The probability to capture a fish was the lowest (0?16) when no attack occurred in the few seconds (1–15 s) prior to a dive and the highest ({\~{}}0?4, i.e. more than twice) when one or two attacks occurred during this time window. The simulation model showed that a prey aggregation disorganized just after an attack and that the maximum of disturbance was obtained a few seconds after the initia- tion of the successive attacks. 5. Our study suggests that, in multispecies predator assemblages, the cumulative effect (through disorganization of school cohesiveness) of the multiple species attacking a prey aggregation may increase the feeding success of each individual. Therefore, facilitation between predators is likely to overcome competition in these multispecific assemblages},

abstract = {Individual quality is often assessed using a static measure of body condition, such as size-corrected body mass. Plasma metabolites have the potential to provide information on the dynamics of physiological state and thus may be better measures of individual performance capacity land fitness). We studied relationships between rate of mass change and circulating levels of triglycerides, glycerol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate in captive Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri). The rate of mass change over one and two days prior to blood sampling was positively related to residual triglyceride (controlling for body mass at sampling) and negatively related to residual glycerol and residual beta-hydroxybutyrate. The relationship between metabolite level and mass change was still apparent over a seven-day interval for glycerol, but not for the other two metabolites. In a stepwise multiple regression of mass change over two days (controlling for body mass), only beta-hydroxybutyrate and glycerol were entered in the model at P {\textless} 0.15. Analysis of group means for seven sampling events showed that body-mass change in a group of individuals was related to mean circulating levels of each metabolite, i.e. to a characteristic metabolite profile. Thus, it may be feasible to employ these metabolites to assess habitat quality based on animal performance (e.g. at migratory stopover sites), or to understand the effects of climatic or anthropogenic factors on the health and survival of animals.},

Here we document the decline of their food stocks in this area, based on a yearly large-scale benthic mapping effort, from 1996 to 2005. For each benthic sampling position, intake rate (mg/s, ash-free dry mass) was predicted by an optimal diet model based on digestive rate maximization. Over the ten years, when accounting for a threshold value to meet energetic fuelling demands, subspecies canutus lost 86{\%} of its suitable foraging area. Over this period, the proportion of probable canutus in mist-net catches in July-August declined relative to overwintering islandica Knots. This suggests that canutus dropped even more in numbers than islandica, for which we showed earlier a food-explained decline in numbers. We discuss the possible causality between a decline in the quality of intertidal mudflats in the Dutch Wadden Sea and population declines of Knots in the West-African wintering quarters.},

abstract = {Monogamous birds exhibit considerable interspecific variation in rates of mate fidelity between years, but the reasons for this variation are still poorly understood. In a 4-year study carried out in western Alaska, mate-fidelity rates in Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla; mate fidelity was 47{\%} among pairs where at least one mate returned and 94{\%} among pairs where both mates returned) were substantially higher than in Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri; 25 and 67{\%}, respectively), despite the similar breeding biology of these sibling species. Divorce was not a response to nesting failure in Western Sandpipers, and mate change had no effect on the reproductive performance of either species. Nor were mate-fidelity rates related to differential rates of breeding dispersal, because the species did not differ in site fidelity. Reunited pairs and males that changed mates showed strong site tenacity, while females that changed mates moved farther. Differences in local survival rates or habitat are also unlikely to explain mate fidelity, since the two species did not differ in local survival rates, phi (Western Sandpipers: {\textless}( )over cap{\textgreater} = 0.57 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- SE), Semipalmated Sandpipers: {\textless}( )over cap{\textgreater} = 0.66 +/- 0.06), and they bred in the same area, sometimes using the same nest cups. Although we were able to reject the above explanations, it was not possible to determine whether mate retention was lower in Western Sandpipers than in Semipalmated Sandpipers because of interspecific differences in mating tactics, time constraints imposed by migration distance, or a combination of these factors. Western Sandpipers exhibited greater sexual size dimorphism, but also migrated for shorter distances and tended to nest earlier and more asynchronously than Semipalmated Sandpipers. Finally, we show that conventional methods underestimate divorce rates, and interspecific comparisons may be biased if breeding-dispersal and recapture rates are not considered.},

However, these studies have largely examined the presence or absence of traits that are responsible for these interactions, without considering natural variation between individuals in the extent to which these traits are manifested. We used a well-documented TMII to investigate the importance of individual behavior type for determining the strength of the TMII. The toadfish Opsanus tau has an indirect positive influence on bivalve survival because the mud crab Panopeus herbstii, a consumer of bivalves, reduces foraging effort in the presence of toadfish. We quantified variation in the strength of persistent individual mud crab responses to toadfish and resulting variation in the strength of TMII. We demonstrate that the strength of this TMII is strongly influenced by mud crab size and behavior type, strengthening with the intensity of response of individual mud crabs to toadfish predator cues. Further, we demonstrate that the spatial distribution within intertidal oyster reefs of crabs with different behavior types is not random; mud crabs inhabiting subtidal areas, where predator cues are more persistent, are significantly less responsive to toadfish cues than mud crabs from intertidal areas. This spatial behavioral structure should lead to spatial variation in the strength of TMII. Given the widespread importance of TMII and the broad occurrence of individual personality or behavior types across numerous taxa, these results should be generally applicable. The distribution of behavior types within a population may therefore be a useful metric for improving our ability to predict the strength of TMII.},

abstract = {It has been argued that the body mass levels achieved by birds are determined by the trade-off between risks of starvation and predation. Birds have also been found to reduce body mass in response to an increased predation risk. During migration, the need of extra fuel for flights is obvious and crucial. In this study, migratory blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) were subject to an experimental stopover situation where the predation risk was manipulated by exposure to a stuffed predator. Blackcaps that perceived an imminent risk of predation increased their food intake and fuel deposition rate during the first period of stopover compared with a control group. The pattern of night activity indicates that birds that were exposed to the predator also chose to leave earlier than birds in the control group. Since there was no cover present at the stopover site, birds might have perceived the risk of predation as higher regardless of whether they were foraging or not. Under such circumstances it has been predicted that birds should increase their foraging activity. The findings in this study clearly indicate that birds are able to adjust their stopover behaviour to perceived predation risk.},

abstract = {Unlike exercising mammals, migratory birds fuel very high intensity exercise (e.g., flight) with fatty acids delivered from the adipose tissue to the working muscles by the circulatory system. Given the primary importance of fatty acids for fueling intense exercise, we discuss the likely limiting steps in lipid transport and oxidation for exercising birds and the ecological factors that affect the quality and quantity of fat stored in wild birds. Most stored lipids in migratory birds are comprised of three fatty acids (16:0, 18:1 and 18:2) even though migratory birds have diverse food habits. Diet selection and selective metabolism of lipids play important roles in determining the fatty acid composition of birds which, in turn, affects energetic performance during intense exercise. As such, migratory birds offer an intriguing model for studying the implications of lipid metabolism and obesity on exercise performance. We conclude with a discussion of the energetic costs of migratory flight and stopover in birds, and its implications for bird migration strategies.},

abstract = {The relationship between flight power and airspeed of birds, as derived from flight mechanical theory, can be used to predict the maximum range speed V-mr which is the optimal speed for minimizing the cost of transport. This speed is not constant but depends on the winds. Earlier predictions about the optimal adjustment of flight speed by birds in relation to winds are only valid in due head- and tailwind situations. We derive V-mr for birds flying along a constant track direction with an arbitrary wind. It emerges that the effect of sidewinds on V-mr depends on the marginal rate of return in groundspeed with an increasing airspeed. This marginal rate increases with the angle between the bird's track and heading direction. Hence, V-mr not only depends on the effect of wind on the bird's actual groundspeed but also on the bird's angle of compensation for the sidewinds. As a result, optimal flight speeds are faster in sidewinds than in tail- or headwinds with a corresponding speed increment caused by wind. The adjustments of optimal airspeed in relation to sidewinds will be analogous also for other characteristic flight speeds besides V-mr, such as the optimal flight speed associated with time-saving rather than energy-saving migration, and with food searching, flight between foraging patches and food delivery flights. We also discuss requirements for empirical tests of the predictions proposed in this paper.},

abstract = {The complexity of habitat structure created by aquatic vegetation is an important factor determining the diversity and composition of soft-sediment coastal communities. The introduction of estuarine organisms, such as oysters or other forms of aquaculture, that compete with existing forms of habitat structure, such as seagrass, may affect the availability of important habitat refugia and foraging resources for mobile estuarine fish and decapods. Fish and invertebrate communities were compared between adjacent patches of native seagrass (Zostera marina), normative cultured oyster (Crassostrea gigas), and unvegetated mudflat within a northeastern Pacific estuary. The composition of epibenthic meiofauna and small macrofaunal organisms, including known prey of fish and decapods, was significantly related to habitat type. Densities of these epifauna were significantly higher in structured habitat compared to unstructured mudflat. Benthic invertebrate densities were highest in seagrass. Since oyster aquaculture may provide a structural substitute for seagrass being associated with increased density and altered composition of fish and decapod prey resources relative to mudflat, it was hypothesized that this habitat might also alter habitat preferences of foraging fish and decapods. The species composition of fish and decapods was more strongly related to location within the estuary than to habitat, and fish and decapod species composition responded on a larger landscape scale than invertebrate assemblages. Fish and decapod species richness and the size of ecologically and commercially important species, such as Dungeness crab (Cancer magister), English sole (Parophrys vetulus), or lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), were not significantly related to habitat type.},

Birds in poor initial condition and those stopping over for a longer period gained more body mass faster. In spring, but not in autumn, the progress of the season was another important factor: late birds gained more body mass. The average rate of body mass gain was 0.179g day-1 ± SE = 0.026.

abstract = {A migrating bird's response to wind can impact its timing, energy expenditure, and path taken. The extent to which nocturnal migrants select departure nights based on wind (wind selectivity) and compensate for wind drift remains unclear. In this paper, we determine the effect of wind selectivity and partial drift compensation on the probability of successfully arriving at a destination area and on overall migration speed. To do so, we developed an individual-based model (IBM) to simulate full drift and partial compensation migration of juvenile Willow Warblers (Phylloscopus trochilus) along the southwesterly (SW) European migration corridor to the Iberian coast. Various degrees of wind selectivity were tested according to how large a drift angle and transport cost (mechanical energy per unit distance) individuals were willing to tolerate on departure after dusk. In order to assess model results, we used radar measurements of nocturnal migration to estimate the wind selectivity and proportional drift among passerines flying in SW directions. Migration speeds in the IBM were highest for partial compensation populations tolerating at least 25{\%} extra transport cost compared to windless conditions, which allowed more frequent departure opportunities. Drift tolerance affected migration speeds only weakly, whereas arrival probabilities were highest with drift tolerances below 20°. The radar measurements were indicative of low drift tolerance, 25{\%} extra transport cost tolerance and partial compensation. We conclude that along migration corridors with generally nonsupportive winds, juvenile passerines should not strictly select supportive winds but partially compensate for drift to increase their chances for timely and accurate arrival.},

abstract = {Meteorological conditions influence strongly the energy and water budget of birds. By adjusting their flights spatially and temporally with respect to these conditions, birds can reduce their energy expenditure and water loss considerably. By radar, we quantified songbird migration across the western Sahara in spring and autumn. There autumn migrants face the trade-off between (a) favorable winds combined with hot and dry air at low altitudes and (b) unfavorable winds combined with humid and cold air higher up. Thus, it can be tested whether birds may chose altitudes to minimize water loss instead of energy expenditure. We predicted optimal flight altitudes with respect to water loss and energy expenditure based on a physiological flight model when crossing the western Sahara and compared these model predictions spatially and temporally with measured songbird densities. The model aiming for minimal water consumption predicted a mean flight altitude of 3,400 m under autumn conditions. However, 64{\%} of the nocturnal songbird migration flew at altitudes below 1,000 m above ground level profiting from tailwind. This preference for tailwind in autumn, despite the hot and dry air, emphasizes the importance of energy savings and diminishes the significance of possible water stress for the selection of flight altitude. Nevertheless, during daytime, high energy expenditure due to air turbulences and water loss due to warmer air and direct solar radiation prevent songbirds from prolonging their nocturnal flights regularly into the day. Birds crossing the Sahara save water by nocturnal flights and diurnal rests.},

abstract = {In theory, survival rates and consequent population status might be predictable from instantaneous behavioural measures of how animals prioritize foraging vs. avoiding predation. We show, for the 30 most common small bird species ringed in the UK, that one quarter respond to higher predation risk as if it is mass-dependent and lose mass. Half respond to predation risk as if it only interrupts their foraging and gain mass thus avoiding consequent increased starvation risk from reduced foraging time. These mass responses to higher predation risk are correlated with population and conservation status both within and between species (and independently of foraging habitat, foraging guild, sociality index and size) over the last 30 years in Britain, with mass loss being associated with declining populations and mass gain with increasing populations. If individuals show an interrupted foraging response to higher predation risk, they are likely to be experiencing a high quality foraging environment that should lead to higher survival. Whereas individuals that show a mass-dependent foraging response are likely to be in lower quality foraging environments, leading to relatively lower survival.},

abstract = {The loss of biodiversity is an ongoing problem and it is essential that a framework is established for revealing the status, identifying threats and monitoring future changes of populations. This study focuses on wader populations in the East Asian-Australasian flyway, and aims to develop a three-step framework for monitoring the status of populations. First, population changes of waders are quantified by estimating population indices from nationwide survey data in Japan between 1975 and 2008. Second, species characteristics shared by declining waders are identified using a phylogenetic comparative method. Finally, based on the revealed characteristics of declining species, composite indices are created for monitoring changes in wader communities in the East Asian-Australasian flyway. The estimated population indices revealed that 12 species out of 41, and 16 out of 42 have declined significantly during spring and autumn migration, respectively, in at least one of the past 10, 20 or 30 year-periods. Phylogenetic comparative analysis revealed that both the use of rice fields and dependence on the Yellow Sea negatively affected the population trends of waders. These results are consistent with the hypothesized negative impact of agricultural intensification caused by land consolidation in Japanese rice fields, and habitat loss and/or degradation in the Yellow Sea caused by the rapid growth of populations and economies in China and South Korea. The framework developed in this study can be applied to a wide range of species, and should play an important role in monitoring population trends and identifying threats to those species in future.

abstract = {We used a combination of modeling and field studies to determine the spring migration strategy of Pectoral Sandpipers (Calidris melanotos). We developed a dynamic programming model to predict patterns that should be detected along the migratory route if Pectoral Sandpipers use a strategy of early arrival at the breeding grounds (time minimization) or arrival at the breeding grounds with excess energy reserves (energy maximization). The predictions were then compared to data collected at stopover sites in the mid-continent of North America and at the breeding grounds in Alaska over a 5-yr period (1992-1996). During spring migration to their Arctic breeding grounds, Pectoral Sandpipers stop periodically to feed. The length-of-stay at such stopovers, for both time minimizers and energy maximizers, was predicted to vary inversely with date and body fat, and to vary directly with invertebrate abundance. We observed that: (1) length-of-stay was negatively correlated with capture date in Missouri and Nebraska, but not in Texas; (2) length-of-stay was not correlated with body fat at any site; and (3) length-of-stay was positively related to invertebrate abundance at the Nebraska and Missouri sites. As the population moves northward in the spring, three regional patterns are diagnostic of migration strategy. Length-of-stay was predicted to be bimodal (energy maximizer) or constant (time minimizer) with respect to latitude, but neither pattern was observed. The migration window, or period of time during which spring migrants occur, was predicted to decrease with increasing latitude for time minimizers, a pattern that was seen for both males and females. Body fat was predicted to increase with latitude for energy maximizers, a pattern that was seen for females but not males. The evidence suggests that males and females differ in their spring migration strategies. Both sexes attempt to arrive in the Arctic as early as possible after ice breakup in the spring. Additionally, females gain significantly higher fat loads than males (up to 60{\%} body fat for females) during migration, and these energy reserves may later enhance female reproductive success. However, females gained large fat loads only during 1993 and 1995, which had above normal spring precipitation along the migration route. We believe that the correlation between female body fat and precipitation reflects an abundance of high-quality stopover habitat during wet springs. This view is supported by model sensitivity analyses showing that the spacing and quality of stopover habitat can strongly influence observed migration patterns. Our results suggest the need to focus additional research on the landscape-level features of the flyway through which shorebirds migrate.},

abstract = {The effects of climate change have wide-ranging impacts on wildlife species and recent studies indicate that birds??? spring arrival dates are advancing in response to changes in global climates. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal approach for comparing avian first arrival data for multiple species. As an example, we analyze spring arrival data for two long-distance migrants (Ruby-throated Hummingbird Archilochus colubris; and Purple Martin Progne subis) in eastern North America from 2001???2010 using Citizen Science data. The proposed approach provides researchers with a tool to compare mean arrival dates while accounting for spatial and temporal variability. Our results show that on average, Purple Martins arrive 29.95 to 31.84 days earlier than Ruby-throated Hummingbirds, but after accounting for this overall difference, spatial nuances exist whereby martins arrive earlier in the southern United States and migrate northward at a slower rate than hummingbirds. Differences were also noted in how climate and weather variables such as the North Atlantic Oscillation index, winter temperature, winter???spring precipitation, sampling effort, and altitude impacted migration dates. Our method may easily be generalized to analyze a broad range of temporal and spatial Citizen Scientists data to help better understand the ecological impacts of climate change.},

@article{VanBelle2007,
abstract = {Summary 1. Forecasting migration intensity can improve flight safety and reduce the operational costs of collisions between aircraft and migrating birds. This is particularly true for military training flights, which can be rescheduled if necessary and often take place at low altitudes and during the night. Migration intensity depends strongly on weather conditions but reported effects of weather differ among studies. It is therefore unclear to what extent existing predictive models can be extrapolated to new situations. 2. We used radar measurements of bird densities in the Netherlands to analyse the relationship between weather and nocturnal migration. Using our data, we tested the performance of three regression models that have been developed for other locations in Europe. We developed and validated new models for different combinations of years to test whether regression models can be used to predict migration intensity in independent years. Model performance was assessed by comparing model predictions against benchmark predictions based on measured migration intensity of the previous night and predictions based on a 6-year average trend. We also investigated the effect of the size of the calibration data set on model robustness. 3. All models performed better than the benchmarks, but the mismatch between measurements and predictions was large for existing models. Model performance was best for newly developed regression models. The performance of all models was best at intermediate migration intensities. The performance of our models clearly increased with sample size, up to about 90 nocturnal migration measurements. Significant input variables included seasonal migration trend, wind profit, 24-h trend in barometric pressure and rain. 4. Synthesis and applications. Migration intensities can be forecast with a regression model based on meteorological data. This and other existing models are only valid locally and cannot be extrapolated to new locations. Model development for new locations requires data sets with representative inter- and intraseasonal variability so that cross-validation can be applied effectively. The Royal Netherlands Air Force currently uses the regression model developed in this study to predict migration intensities 3 days ahead. This improves the reliability of migration intensity warnings and allows rescheduling of training flights if needed.

abstract = {Most populations of migrant shorebirds around the world are in serious decline, suggesting that vital condition-dependent rates such as fecundity and annual survival are being affected globally. A striking example is the red knot (Calidris canutus rufa) population wintering in Tierra del Fuego, which undertakes marathon 30,000 km hemispheric migrations annually. In spring, migrant birds forage voraciously on horseshoe crab eggs in Delaware Bay in the eastern USA before departing to breed in Arctic polar deserts. From 1997 to 2002 an increasing proportion of knots failed to reach threshold departure masses of 180-200 g, possibly because of later arrival in the Bay and food shortage from concurrent over-harvesting of crabs. Reduced nutrient storage, especially in late-arriving birds, possibly combined with reduced sizes of intestine and liver during refuelling, had severe fitness consequences for adult survival and recruitment of young in 2000-2002. From 1997 to 2002 known survivors in Delaware Bay were heavier at initial capture than birds never seen again, annual survival of adults decreased by 37{\%} between May 2000 and May 2001, and the number of second-year birds in wintering flocks declined by 47{\%}. Population size in Tierra del Fuego declined alarmingly from 51,000 to 27,000 in 2000-2002, seriously threatening the viability of this subspecies. Demographic modelling predicts imminent endangerment and an increased risk of extinction of the subspecies without urgent risk-averse management.},

abstract = {For migrant birds, which habitats are suitable during the non-breeding season influences habitat availability, population resilience to habitat loss, and ultimately survival. Consequently, habitat preferences during winter and whether habitat segregation according to age and sex occurs directly influences migration ecology, survival and breeding success. We tested the fine-scale habitat preferences of a declining Palearctic migrant, the whinchat Saxicola rubetra, on its wintering grounds in west Africa. We explored the influence of habitat at the territory-scale and whether dominance-based habitat occupancy occurs by describing the variation in habitat characteristics across wintering territories, the degree of habitat change within territories held throughout winter, and whether habitat characteristics influenced territory size and space-use within territories or differed with age and sex. Habitat characteristics varied substantially across territories and birds maintained the same territories even though habitat changed significantly throughout winter. We found no evidence of dominance-based habitat occupancy; instead, territories were smaller if they contained more perching shrubs or maize crops, and areas with more perching shrubs were used more often within territories, likely because perches are important for foraging and territory defence. Our findings suggest that whinchats have non-specialised habitat requirements within their wintering habitat of open savannah and farmland, and respond to habitat variation by adjusting territory size and space-use within their territories instead of competing with conspecifics. Whinchats show a tolerance for human-modified habitats and results support previous findings that some crop types may provide high-quality wintering habitat by increasing perch density and foraging opportunities. By having non-specialised requirements within broad winter habitat types, migrants are likely to be flexible to changing wintering conditions in Africa, both within and across winters, so possibly engendering some resilience to the rapid anthropogenic habitat degradation occurring throughout their wintering range.},

abstract = {Releasing animals in more than one location may increase or decrease the probability of success of a reintroduction project, yet the question of how many release sites to use has received little attention. We used empirical data from the reintroduction program of the Persian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) (Galilee region in northern Israel) in an individual-based spatially explicit simulation model to assess the effects of releasing deer from multiple sites. We examined whether multiple release sites increase reintroduction success, and if so, whether the optimal number of sites for a given scenario can be determined and whether the outcome differs if animals are released alternately (i.e., the location of the release alternates yearly between sites) or consecutively (i.e., one release site is used for several years, then another is used, and so forth). We selected 8 potential release sites in addition to the original site and simulated the release of 180 individuals at a rate of 10 individuals per year in different combinations of the original site and 1-4 additional sites. In our model, releasing animals into the wild at multiple sites produced higher population growth and greater spatial expansion than releasing animals at only one site and a consecutive-release approach was superior to an alternate-release approach. We suggest that through the use of simulation modeling that is based on empirical data from previous releases, managers can make better-informed decisions regarding the use of multiple release sites and greatly improve the probability of reintroduction success.},

abstract = {In Chapter 12, principal component analysis (PCA) was introduced. The visual presentation of the PCA results is by plotting the axes (scores) in a graph. Some books use the phrase scores are plotted in a Euclidian space. What this means is that the scores can be plotted in a Cartesian axes system, another notation is 2, and the Pythagoras theorem can be used to calculate distances between scores. The problem is that PCA is based on the correlation or covariance coefficient, and this may not always be the most appropriate measure of association. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) is a method that, just like PCA, is based on an eigenvalue equation, but it can use any measure of association (Chapter 10). Just like PCA, the axes are plotted against each other in a Euclidean space, but the PCoA does not produce a biplot (a joint plot of the variables and observations).},

abstract = {Predation is a central feature of ecological communities. Most theoretical and empirical studies of predation focus on the consequences of predators consuming their prey. Predators reduce prey population densities through direct consumption (a density-mediated interaction, DMI), a process that may indirectly affect the prey's resources, com-petitors, and other predators. However, predators can also affect prey population density by stimulating costly defensive strategies. The costs of these defensive strategies can include reduced energy income, energetic investment in defensive structures, lower mating success, increased vulnerability to other predators, or emigration. Theoretical and empirical studies confirm the existence of these induced costs (trait-mediated interactions, TMIs); however, the relative importance of intimidation (TMI) and consumption (DMI) effects remains an open question. We conducted a meta-analysis assessing the magnitude of both TMIs and DMIs in predator–prey interactions. On average, the impact of intimidation on prey de-mographics was at least as strong as direct consumption (63{\%} and 51{\%} the size of the total predator effect, respectively). This contrast is even more pronounced when we consider the cascading effects of predators on their prey's resources: density effects attenuated through food chains, while TMIs remained strong, rising to 85{\%} of the total predator effect. Predators can thus strongly influence resource density even if they consume few prey items. Finally, intimidation was more important in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems. Our results suggest that the costs of intimidation, traditionally ignored in predator–prey ecology, may actually be the dominant facet of trophic interactions.},

Comparisons involved the negative exponential and half-normal detection functions for expected sample sizes of 40, 60, and 100 and three levels of spatial aggregation. Efficiency and bias were computed as functions of strip transect width, w. Final comparisons were based on mean square errors (MSE), also as a function of w. The line transect estimator always had a smaller MSE than the strip transect estimator when the detection function was a negative exponential. Therefore, line transect sampling is preferred when detectability drops off rapidly with increasing distance from the line. The line transect estimator had a smaller MSE for most combinations of spatial aggregation and strip width, w, for the half-normal detection function. In general, the results indicate a preference for the line transect method over strip transect on the basis of bias and efficiency.},

abstract = {Regime shifts are large, long-lasting changes in ecosystems. They are often hard to predict but may have leading indicators which are detectable in advance. Potential leading indicators include wider swings in dynamics of key ecosystem variables, slower return rates after perturbation and shift of variance towards lower frequencies. We evaluated these indicators using a food web model calibrated to long-term whole-lake experiments. We investigated whether impending regime shifts driven by gradual increase in exploitation of the top predator can create signals that cascade through food webs and be discerned in phytoplankton. Substantial changes in standard deviations, return rates and spectra occurred near the switch point, even two trophic levels removed from the regime shift in fishes. Signals of regime shift can be detected well in advance, if the driver of the regime shift changes much more slowly than the dynamics of key ecosystem variables which can be sampled frequently enough to measure the indicators. However, the regime shift may occur long after the driver has passed the critical point, because of very slow transient dynamics near the critical point. Thus, the ecosystem can be poised for regime shift by the time the signal is discernible. Field tests are needed to evaluate these indicators.},

abstract = {1. Migrant bird populations are declining and have been linked to anthropogenic climate change. The phenology mismatch hypothesis predicts that migrant birds, which experience a greater rate of warming in their breeding grounds compared to their wintering grounds, are more likely to be in decline, because their migration will occur later and they may then miss the early stages of the breeding season. Population trends will also be negatively correlated with distance, because the chances of phenology mismatch increase with number of staging sites. 2. Population trends from the Palaearctic (1990-2000) and Nearctic (1980-2006) were collated for 193 spatially separate migrant bird populations, along with temperature trends for the wintering and breeding areas. An index of phenology mismatch was calculated as the difference between wintering and breeding temperature trends. 3. In the Nearctic, phenology mismatch was correlated with population declines as predicted, but in the Palaearctic, distance was more important. This suggests that differential global climate change may be responsible for contributing to some migrant species' declines, but its effects may be more important in the Nearctic. 4. Differences in geography and so average migration distance, migrant species composition and history of anthropogenic change in the two areas may account for the differences in the strength of the importance of phenology mismatch on migrant declines in the Nearctic and Palaearctic.},

abstract = {As a response to increasing spring temperature in temperate regions in recent years, populations of many plant and animal species, including migratory birds, have advanced the seasonal start of their reproduction or growth. However, the effects of climate changes on subsequent events of the annual cycle remain poorly understood. We investigated long???term changes in the timing of autumn migration in birds, a key event in the annual cycle limiting the reproductive period. Using data spanning a 42???year period, we analysed long???term changes in the passage of 65 species of migratory birds through Western Europe. The autumn passage of migrants wintering south of the Sahara has advanced in recent years, presumably as a result of selection pressure to cross the Sahel before its seasonal dry period. In contrast, migrants wintering north of the Sahara have delayed autumn passage. In addition, species with a variable rather than a fixed number of broods per year have delayed passage, possibly because they are free to attempt more broods. Recent climate changes seem to have a simple unidirectional effect on the seasonal onset of reproduction, but complex and opposing effects on the timing of subsequent events in the annual cycle, depending on the ecology and life history of a species. This complicates predictions of overall effects of global warming on avian communities.},

abstract = {One hypothesis to explain the phenomenon of high bivalve recruitment after severe winters in coastal North Sea sediments is reduced epibenthic predation. Using predator exclusion experiments, I tested the hypothesis that epibenthic predation on the juvenile bivalves Cerastoderma edule, Macoma balthica and Mya arenaria was lower after a severe winter (1995 to 1996) than after a moderate (1996 to 1997) and a mild (1997 to 1998) winter. In C. edule and M. arenaria there was 2-fold evidence for reduced epibenthic predation after the severe winter: (1) significant predation effects occurred only in exclusion experiments after the 2 milder winters but not after the severe winter; and (2) recruits attained larger sizes in August and October after the severe winter suggesting continuous growth rather than truncation of the size spectrum by predators. In M balthica, predation effects were also significant only after the milder winters but there was no effect on size. In all 3 bivalve species, recruitment at the experimental sites in the fall was higher after the severe winter than after the 2 milder ones. These results suggest that high bivalve recruitment after severe winters is primarily caused by the post-settlement factor of reduced epibenthic predation on the tidal flats. The strategy to conduct several predator exclusion experiments in both sand and mud in 3 consecutive years with differential winter conditions, and while considering migration activity and size development in juvenile bivalves, proved useful to distinguish between cage artefacts and predation effects.},

abstract = {Larger-bodied species in a wide range of taxonomic groups including mammals, fishes and birds tend to decline more steeply and are at greater risk of extinction. Yet, the diversity in life histories is governed not only by body size, but also by time-related traits. A key question is whether this size-dependency of vulnerability also holds, not just locally, but globally across a wider range of environments. We test the relative importance of size- and time-related life-history traits and fishing mortality in determining population declines and current exploitation status in tunas and their relatives. We use high-quality datasets of half a century of population trajectories combined with population-level fishing mortalities and life-history traits. Time-related traits (e.g. growth rate), rather than size-related traits (e.g. maximum size), better explain the extent and rate of declines and current exploitation status across tuna assemblages, after controlling for fishing mortality. Consequently, there is strong geographical patterning in population declines, such that populations with slower life histories (found at higher cooler latitudes) have declined most and more steeply and have a higher probability of being overfished than populations with faster life histories (found at tropical latitudes). Hence, the strong, temperature-driven, latitudinal gradients in life-history traits may underlie the global patterning of population declines, fisheries collapses and local extinctions.},

abstract = {1. Bet-hedging of innate migratory orientation of juvenile passerines may be a fitness-enhancing strategy for fall migration. Experimental studies support the view that juvenile passerines on their first migration to unknown winter grounds orient on a predetermined vector programme and make little or no adjustment for wind displacement. This trait, coupled with the unpredictable profile of wind speed and direction that the juvenile will encounter during migration, suggests that the fitness of a parent's juvenile offspring will be highly variable from year to year. Under these circumstances, within-clutch phenotypic variation in migratory orientation may be evolutionarily favoured. 2. To explore this hypothesis, a migration model is developed for a small passerine with breeding grounds in New England and winter grounds in the Caribbean. Parameterization is based on life history data of the neotropical migrant Dendroica caerulescens, the black-throated blue warbler. The model is simulated for the offspring of 20 000 adult females under each of a wide range of potential orientation programmes, incorporating stochastic wind profiles along potential migratory routes, based on 7 years of wind data for eastern North America. 3. Under these simulations, bet-hedging in the form of within-clutch variation of migratory orientation strongly dominates within-clutch homogeneity, yielding higher geometric mean fitness in all vector programmes considered. 4. The simulation results provide a potential explanation for the variation observed in the tracks of juvenile passerines. Bet-hedging also explains the extensively-documented 'coastal effect' in which fall banding stations along the Atlantic coast of the United States consistently capture a much higher percentage of juvenile birds than do more inland stations. 5. Bet-hedging is consistent with the published finding that slower flying birds exhibit greater variation in their migratory orientation than faster flying birds. 6. The bet-hedging model of migratory orientation presented in this paper provides a theoretical structure capable of organizing a diverse collection of field and laboratory observations as predictable consequences of an evolutionarily favoured strategy. This theory may constitute a major advance in our understanding of bird migration and thus justifies the design and execution of new laboratory and field experiments to assess its power and predictive reach.},

abstract = {Shorebirds are thought to be declining across North America but trend analyses for migrant shorebirds at interior sites in eastern North America have not been updated since the late 1990s. Data from a volunteer-based survey at stopover sites throughout Ontario were used to assess population trends of shorebirds over the period 1974-2009. Surveyors carried out 7,135 surveys of 258 sites and recorded 538,744 individuals of 43 shorebird species. Of 19 taxa for which trends were estimated, 17 appeared to be declining in abundance. Precision of the trend estimates was generally poor and only three declines Were significant alpha = 0.05. Total numbers of shorebirds recorded on surveys declined by four per cent per year, resulting in an estimated decrease in abundance of greater than 75{\%} over the 35 years of observation. Rate of decline may be increasing for some species as declines for twelve species were larger for the period 1989-2009 vs. 1974-1989, and six species showed significant declines in the latter period whereas none did in the former period. Relating these declines in abundance at the surveyed sites to population declines is complicated by, several potential sources of survey bias including changes in turnover rates and in migration timing and distributions of the species. However, given that these results are consistent with those of other migration surveys as well as those on the breeding and the wintering grounds, the most parsimonious explanation remains a widespread decline in shorebird populations.

abstract = {Metcalfe {\&} Ure (1995) reported strong effects of natural body mass variation on time to fly to cover by zebra finches. They observed that escape time was a roughly linear function of body mass whereas models have often assumed accelerating relations between fat reserves and predation risk. To translate escape time into predation risk, one needs to know the distribution of distances at which approaching predators are detected. This depends on the vigilance behaviour of the prey. Here I show that predation risk per attack will increase exponentially with time to reach protective cover for a commonly observed pattern of scanning by birds. Besides influencing fattening decisions, this rapidly increasing relation may also explain the observed reluctance of many foragers to venture more than a few metres from protective cover. The data presented by Metcalfe {\&} Ure are perfectly compatible with recent theory and perhaps even more important than stated by the authors. TS - RIS},

abstract = {While it is widely understood that local abundance of benthic invertebrates can greatly influence the distribution and abundance of wetland birds, no studies have examined if wetland landscape context can mediate this relationship. We studied the influence of wetland food abundance and landscape context on use of agricultural wetlands by wintering dunlin (Calidris alpina) and killdeer (Charadrius vociferus) in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, USA, over two winters (1999-2000, 2000-2001) of differing rainfall and subsequent habitat distribution. We monitored bird use (frequency of occurrence and abundance) at a sample of wetlands differing in local food abundance (density and biomass) and landscape context [adjacent shorebird habitat (defined as ha of wet habitat with less than 50{\%} vegetative cover and within a 2-km radius) and nearest neighbor distance]. We evaluated predictive models for bird use using linear regression and the Cp criterion to select the most parsimonious model. During the dry winter (2000-2001), dunlin exhibited greater use of sites with higher invertebrate density and biomass but also with more adjacent shorebird habitat and closest to a wetland neighbor. However, neither landscape context nor food abundance were important predictors of dunlin use during the wet winter (1999-2000). Use of sites by killdeer was unrelated to either local food abundance or landscape context measures during both winters. Our findings contribute to a growing recognition of the importance of landscape structure to wetland birds and highlight a number of implications for the spatial planning and enhancement of wetlands using a landscape approach.},

@article{Schmaljohann2017a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited. Predicting the range of variation over which organisms can adjust to environmental change is a major challenge in ecology. This is exemplified in migratory birds which experience changes in different habitats throughout the annual cycle. Earlier studies showed European population trends declining strongest in migrant species with least adjustment in spring arrival time. Thus, the increasing mismatches with other trophic levels in seasonal breeding areas probably contribute to their large-scale decline. Here we quantify the potential range of adjusting spring arrival dates through modifying migration speeds by reviewing 49 tracking studies. Among-individual variation in migration speed was mainly determined by the relatively short stop-over duration. Assuming this population response reflects individual phenotypic plasticity, we calculated the potential for phenotypic plasticity to speed-up migration by reducing stop-over duration. Even a 50{\%} reduction would lead to a mere two-day advance in arrival, considering adjustments on the final 2,000 km of the spring journey. Hence, in contrast to previous studies, flexibility in the major determinant of migration duration seems insufficient to adjust to ongoing climate change, and is unlikely to explain some of the observed arrival advancements in long-distance migrants.},

@article{Botto2000,
abstract = {Southwestern Atlantic estuaries (Southern Brazil to Northern Patagonia, Argentina) are characterized by the presence of an intertidal burrowing crab Chasmagnathus granulata. This crab species is an important bioturbator which lives in large assemblages and excavates semi-permanent burrows that affect sediment characteristics. Our observations showed that distribution of the crabs in the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon, Argentina (37 degrees 45'S, 57 degrees 26'W) affected habitat use and feeding success of migratory shorebirds. During the migratory season the two-banded plover (Charadrius falklandicus) foraged more frequently inside crab beds, and yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes and T. melanoleuca) fed more frequently outside crab beds. Focal observations on the feeding behavior of the white-rumped sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis) and the two-banded plover inside and outside crab beds showed that the plover was a visual searcher and captured more prey inside crab beds, and the white-rumped sandpiper was a tactile feeder. Although consumption rates (prey min(-1)) did not differ between sites, their efficiency (prey probe(-1)) inside crab beds was less. These differences were probably related to changes in sediment characteristics and prey behavior, which vary with crab activity. Burrowing crabs alter the suitability of intertidal habitats used by shorebirds in southwestern Atlantic estuaries, We believe that the same profess could be occurring with other burrowing crustaceans such as thalassinidean shrimps in other estuaries of the world and could have important implications for management of flats for shorebirds.},

abstract = {In a periodically changing environment it is important for animals to properly time the major events of their life in order to maximise their lifetime fitness. For a non-migratory bird the timing of breeding and moult are thought to be the most crucial. We develop a state-dependent optimal annual routine model that incorporates explicit density dependence in the food supply. In the model the birds' decisions depend on the time of year, their energy reserves, breeding status, experience, and the quality of two types of feathers (outer and inner primaries). Our model predicts that, under a seasonal environment, feathers with large effects on flight ability, higher abrasion rate and lower energetic cost of moult should be moulted closer to the winter (i.e. later) than those with the opposite attributes. Therefore, we argue that the sequence of moult may be an adaptive response to the problem of optimal timing of moult of differing feathers within the same feather tract. The model also predicts that environmental seasonality greatly affects optimal annual routines. Under high seasonality birds breed first then immediately moult, whereas under low seasonality an alternation occurs between breeding and moulting some of the feathers in one year and having a complete moult but no breeding in the other year. Increasing food abundance has a similar effect.},

The theory of rational choice is based on axiomatic principles such as transitivity and independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). Empirical studies have demonstrated that the behaviour of humans and other animals often seems irrational; there can be a lack of transitivity in choice and seemingly irrelevant alternatives can alter decisions. These violations of transitivity and IIA undermine rational choice theory. However, we show that an individual that is maximizing its rate of food gain can exhibit failure of transitivity and IIA. We show that such violations can be caused because a current option may disappear in the near future or a better option may reappear soon. Current food options can be indicative of food availability in the near future, and this key feature can result in apparently irrational behaviour.},

Five individuals were flown for periods of approximately 2 min, while carrying additional payload mass amounting to between 5 and 20{\%} of unloaded body mass. The energy cost of flight was measured using the 13C-labelled bicarbonate technique, which was also calibrated in a separate experiment on resting birds, by comparing the elimination rate of 13C in breath with a simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption by indirect calorimetry. It was not possible to perform a similar calibration during flight when energy costs were higher, so we extrapolated the relationship from the resting calibration to predict flight cost. Flight cost in the pre-manipulated individuals averaged 16.7±1.8 W. Flight cost in the pre-manipulated birds was significantly related to the interaction between downstroke duration and flight speed. There was no significant increase in flight cost with increases in payload mass. The birds responded to payload masses between 5 and 15{\%} of their unloaded body mass by decreasing flight speed relative to unloaded birds, while maintaining wing beat frequency (Fb). At a payload mass equivalent to 20{\%} of body mass, however, the birds flew at higher speeds than unloaded controls, and had a significantly higher Fb, generated by a reduction in both the upstroke and downstroke durations. Wing amplitude was unaffected by the increase in loading. Using the measured flight parameters, the effect of loading was not significantly different than predicted using aerodynamic models.},

The best-fit model included a constant apparent survival probability (phi = 0.489; 95{\%} Cl = 0.410-0.569), but several models fit nearly as well, and averaging among the top five, to account for model uncertainty, suggested that adults had somewhat higher values than juveniles (phi = 0.490 +/- 0.051 vs. 0.450 +/- 0.067). Detection probability was substantially higher for adults than for juveniles (p = 0.741 vs. p = 0.537). Those apparent survival estimates are low compared with those from other studies of Western Sandpipers at breeding and other nonbreeding locations, and substantially lower than the true survivorship rates expected for small sandpipers in general.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Migratory shorebirds need to replenish their energy reserves by foraging at stop-over sites en route. Adjusting their foraging behaviour to accommodate variation in local prey availability would therefore be advantageous. We test whether western sandpipers (Calidris mauri), a sexually dimorphic shorebird, adjust their foraging behaviour ill response to local changes in prey availability, as inferred by changes in diurnal time and sediment temperature. Both males and females showed quantitative changes to foraging mode in relation to each of these variables. Probing, for example. which is used to exploit infaunal prey, was significantly more common at higher temperatures. The results presented here are consistent with the notion that western sandpipers call adjust their foraging behaviour ill response to variation in prey availability. Further, we speculate that temperature-induced changes to prey location may contribute to the striking Sexual segregation observed for this species during the non-breeding season.},

abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that birds are selected to minimize the time spent on migration, that is, to migrate as fast as possible, Optimal fat loads in time-selected migration were predicted for different rates of fat accumulation at stopover sites. We analyzed departure fat loads of migrating bluethroats Luscinia svecica svecica, experimentally provided with extra food at a stopover site, and of migrating rufous hummingbirds Selasphorus rufus, which showed considerable individual variation in fat-deposition rate, in relation to these predictions. We found qualitative agreement with the time-minimization hypothesis. However, quantitative agreement requires that specific assumptions be fulfilled for both species: (1) consistent differences in expected speed of migration should exist between different individuals of the same species and/or (2) the expected speed of migration should increase along the route. Both of these assumptions are probably valid, and ringing data suggest an increase in bluethroat autumn migration speed along the route. Physiological and flight mechanical constraints will prevent birds from depositing excessively large amounts of fuel. These assumptions and constraints should be taken into account in future critical tests of the hypothesis that natural selection operates to maximize the speed of migration.},

abstract = {Studies on the impact of climate change on the distributions of bird species in Europe have largely focused on one season at time, especially concerning summer breeding ranges. We investigated whether migratory bird species show consistent range shifts over the past 55 years in both breeding and wintering areas or if these shifts are independent. We then analyzed whether patterns in changing migration distances of Finnish breeding birds could be explained by habitat use, phylogeny or body size. We used long-term datasets from the Finnish ringing centre to analyze the mean wintering latitudes of 29 species of Finnish breeding birds, then used breeding distribution data to make predictions as to whether certain species were migrating shorter or longer distances based on the comparative shifts in the wintering and breeding grounds. Our data reveal species-specific differences in changing migration distances. We show that for many species, long-term shifts in wintering ranges have not followed the same patterns as those in the breeding range, leading to differences in migration distances over time. We conclude that species are not adjusting predictably to climate change in their wintering grounds, leading to changing migration distances in some, but not all, species breeding in Finland. This research fills an important gap in the current climate change biology literature, focusing on individuals' entire life histories and revealing new complexities in range shift patterns.},

The durations of inter-scan intervals of preening sanderlings, Calidris alba, were not predictable from any of the preceding inter-scan interval durations. However, examination of the differences between successive inter-scan interval durations provided a means of describing the sequences: the differences were predictable using models based on negative autocorrelations, Similar results were obtained for sequences from other species. The predictability of vigilance sequences is therefore dependent upon the level of analysis. Some causal and functional interpretations of the derived autoregression models are discussed. Simulations showed that the models could account for periodicities previously reported without invoking oscillatory mechanisms.},

abstract = {In most shallow water marine systems, fluid movements vary on scales that may influence local community dynamics both directly, through changes in the abundance of species, and indirectly, by modifying important behaviors of organisms. We examined how differences in current speed affect the outcome of predator-prey interactions for two species of marine benthic predators (knobbed whelks, Busycon carica, and blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus) foraging on two common prey species (bay scallops, Argopecten irradians, and hard clams, Mercenaria mercenaria). The predators differ in their foraging strategies and prey in their potential escape responses. Predation by blue crabs, highly mobile predators/scavengers that rely upon chemical odors transported in the water column to locate prey, could be strongly affected by changes in current speed and turbulent mixing because their foraging strategy relies on a high degree of spatial integration of prey odor plumes. Whelks, slow moving, predatory gastropods that often forage with their bodies buried in the sediment, may be less susceptible to flow-induced distortion of prey odor plumes because their sluggish movements result in a high degree of temporal integration of prey odors. Bay scallops, relatively mobile bivalves capable of raped short-distance swimming burst, and hard clams, sedentary bivalves, have been shown to respond to varying degrees to predator odors that are dispersed in the water column. Flow regime for the predator-prey experiments was manipulated in situ using large channels. Predation by blue crabs on both juvenile hard clams and bay scallops decreased with increases in water flow (0 12 vs. 0-30 cm s(-1)). Whelk predation on bay scallops increased with increases in water flow, whereas predation by whelks on hard clams did not differ between flow regimes. For blue crabs movement decreased at periods of high water flow. Because blue crabs locate prey through chemolocation of water-borne cues, which are diluted rapidly at higher flows, decreases in foraging may result from the inability to successfully detect prey at enhanced flows. Differences in predation by whelks could not be explained by a similar mechanism. Visual observations of foraging whelks revealed no differences in whelk behavior between the two flow regimes. The pattern of higher whelk predation on scallops at enhanced flow is likely to be related to a flow-inhibiting ability of scallops to detect predator approach. Thus, flow enhancement interferes with three of the predator-prey systems but the effect on predator success depends on whether the predator or prey is most affected. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the ground surveys, we used double sampling to estimate detection ratios. We used the aerial survey data to compare densities of birds and Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), the major nest predator of birds, on the North Slope, in Prudhoe Bay, and in nearby areas. We partitioned the Prudhoe Bay oil field into 2 × 2 km plots and determined the relation between density of aquatic birds and density of roads, buildings, and other infrastructure in these plots. Abundance and density (birds per square kilometer) of 3 groups of aquatic birds-waterfowl, loons, and grebes; shorebirds; and gulls, terns, and jaegers-were highest in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPRA) and lowest in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Six other major wetlands occur in the Arctic regions of Canada and Russia, but the largest population of aquatic birds was in the NPRA. Aquatic birds were concentrated in the northern part of the NPRA. For example, an area that covered 18{\%} of the NPRA included 53{\%} of its aquatic birds. The aerial surveys showed that bird density was not lower and fox density was not higher in Prudhoe Bay than in surrounding areas. Density of infrastructure did not significantly affect bird density for any group of species. Our results establish that the NPRA is one of the most important areas for aquatic birds in the Arctic. Our results and those of others also indicate that oil production, as practiced in Prudhoe Bay, does not necessarily lead to substantial declines in bird density or productivity in or near the developed areas.

abstract = {The present publication follows an earlier report that described the physical and biological environment, prey organisms, and ecology waterbirds in the Strait of Georgia. The authors compare the year-round abundance, distribution, and energy consumption of birds in five large estuaries and one small urban estuary in the Strait of Georgia and use the traditional definition of an estuary: the lower deltaic portion of a river and the nearby shallow waters in the freshwater plume. Some birds population in the Fraser River estuary on the southeast shore of the Strait of Georgia exceed levels established in the Ramsar Convention to rank the ornithological significance of wetlands (Bulter and Campbell 1987; Morrison et al. 1991). However, the significance of other estuaries to birds has not been assessed, although many have lost large amounts of bird habitat to human developments (Campbell Prentice and Boyd 1988). The use of estuarine habitats on the west coast of Canada has not been described for many species, and the role of birds in the energy flow of estuaries has received little attention. Moreover, the rapidly growing human population around the Strait of Georgia adds new pressure on bird habitats. This population provides information to assess the conservation significance of estuaries in the Strait of Georgia to waterbird populations on the Pacific coast. In addition, new information is provided on habitat requirements and population estimates of internationally significant populations of Trumpeter Swans Cygnus buccinator, Western Sandpipers Calidris mauri, and Dunlins C. alpina. Habitat use by waterbirds in one estuary and energy consumption by waterbirds at different trophic levels in six estuaries are described. We believe that the information will be useful for ornithologists and ecologists, as well as for coastal managers and members of conservation organizations.},

The EU Commission's proposal for a reformed Common Fisheries Policy calls for more self-management for the fishing industry by increasing fishers' involvement in the planning and execution of policies and boosting the role of fishers' organisations. One way of higher transparency and improved participation is to include stakeholders in the modelling process itself. The JAKFISH project (Judgment And Knowledge in Fisheries Involving StakeHolders) invited fisheries stakeholders to participate in the process of framing the management problem, and to give input and evaluate the scientific models that are used to provide fisheries management advice. JAKFISH investigated various tools to assess and communicate uncertainty around fish stock assessments and fisheries management. Here, a synthesis is presented of the participatory work carried out in four European fishery case studies (Western Baltic herring, North Sea Nephrops, Central Baltic Herring and Mediterranean swordfish), focussing on the uncertainty tools used, the stakeholders' responses to these, and the lessons learnt. It is concluded that participatory modelling has the potential to facilitate and structure discussions between scientists and stakeholders about uncertainties and the quality of the knowledge base. It can also contribute to collective learning, increase legitimacy, and advance scientific understanding. However, when approaching real-life situations, modelling should not be seen as the priority objective. Rather, the crucial step in a science-stakeholder collaboration is the joint problem framing in an open, transparent way. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {During annual migrations between breeding and nonbreeding grounds, billions of land birds encounter migratory barriers en route. Although birds are thought to be more selective (i.e., cross under favorable wind conditions) and spend more time refueling at stopover sites when confronted with these barriers, there is no direct evidence to support these hypotheses. Using 2 automated radio-telemetry arrays at stopover sites situated before (south of) and after (north of) a large ecological barrier (Lake Erie), we tracked departure decisions of American redstarts Setophaga ruticilla and yellow-rumped (myrtle) warblers Setophaga coronata coronata during spring migration. We found evidence that condition, age, and tailwind assistance were all positively correlated with the likelihood of depar- ture. Interestingly, these patterns did not differ between species, with presumably differing migratory tactics, nor across sites, sug- gesting that during spring migration, migratory songbirds may follow general rules for departure from stopover sites, despite varying ecological and life-history contexts. Key words: automated radio-telemetry, Cox Proportional Hazards model, departure decisions, migration, migratory strategies, songbird.},

In 199598 numbers of Red Knots in our study area in the western Dutch Wadden Sea usually built up in late July towards maxima of 10 000-20 000 individuals in August and early September. In each of these four years we attached tiny (1.3-1.8 g) radiotransmitters to a total of 95 molecularly sexed adults to determine the length of stay of different categories of birds. The 65 females (68{\%}) predominated the samples, and among the females the majority (48 birds) was captured without traces of wing moult. In females, but not in males, birds caught in wing moult stayed significantly longer than nonmoulting birds. Non-moulting females weighed up to 200 g and disappeared within three weeks after being marked. The timing of their disappearance corresponded with observed departures of flocks towards the southwest, and published departure times of canutus. The relationship between length of stay and mass at capture of these early departing nonmoulting females suggests a daily mass gain of about 2.84 g dol. These birds had a mean bill length that was 1 rom (yet significantly) longer than those of the other female categories; a relatively long bill is a well known attribute of canutus. The much smaller sample of males with similar mass, moult and staging time characteristics did not show longer bill lengths and we are thus unable to unambiguously confirm the presence of canutus males in late July and early August; this bias remains to be functionally},

abstract = {Optimality reasoning from behavioural ecology can be used as a tool to infer how animals perceive their environment. Using optimality principles in a 'reversed manner' may enable ecologists to predict changes in population size before such changes actually happen. Here we show that a behavioural anti-predation trait (burrowing depth) of the marine bivalve Macoma balthica can be used as an indicator of the change in population size over the year to come. The per capita population growth rate between years t and t+1 correlated strongly with the proportion of individuals living in the dangerous top 4 cm layer of the sediment in year t: the more individuals in the top layer, the steeper the population decline. This is consistent with the prediction based on optimal foraging theory that animals with poor prospects should accept greater risks of predation. This study is among the first to document fitness forecasting in animals.},

abstract = {Sexual segregation outside the mating season is common in vertebrates, and has been attributed to sexual differences in predator escape performance in ungulates and fish, but not in birds. Here, we tested the hypothesis that sex- and latitude-specific predator escape performance underlies the differential nonbreeding distribution of west ern sandpipers (Calidris mauri), a migratory shorebird. Females overwinter further south along the American Pacific coast, creating a latitudinal cline in sex ratio. Escape performance is reduced with increasing body mass, and birds generally carry less fat further south. Western sandpipers with poor escape performance were therefore predicted to prefer southern sites to reduce the risk of mortality posed by predators. Data from four nonbreeding latitudes showed that wing loading, used as an index of escape performance, was overall higher for females, and that it decreased with latitude in both sexes. Within lati tudes, wing loading was lower at smaller, and presumably more dangerous, sites. Right response to a predatory attack was longer in the south. Mortality risk offers a novel and candidate explanation for differential distribution patterns in western sandpipers and possibly other avian migrants.},

abstract = {Behavioural ecologists often study complex systems in which multiple hypotheses could be proposed to explain observed phenomena. For some systems, simple controlled experiments can be employed to reveal part of the complexity; often, however, observational studies that incorporate a multitude of causal factors may be the only (or preferred) avenue of study. We assess the value of recently advocated approaches to inference in both contexts. Specifically, we examine the use of information theoretic (IT) model selection using Akaike's information criterion (AIC). We find that, for simple analyses, the advantages of switching to an IT-AIC approach are likely to be slight, especially given recent emphasis on biological rather than statistical significance. By contrast, the model selection approach embodied by IT approaches offers significant advantages when applied to problems of more complex causality. Model averaging is an intuitively appealing extension to model selection. However, we were unable to demonstrate consistent improvements in prediction accuracy when using model averaging with IT-AIC; our equivocal results suggest that more research is needed on its utility. We illustrate our arguments with worked examples from behavioural experiments.},

However, abundance has only been quantified recently via aerial surveys. In 1992 we censused Chametla beach within ensenada de La Paz, to quantify shorebirds' seasonal variation. The western sandpiper was the most numerous species during fall migration (late July to early November), and during the winter period (November to March) especially. In contrast to the eastern shore of the Gulf of California, we did not detect a spring migration increase, and assumed that the area is used exclusively for the fall migration and for wintering. There are two habitats available: marsh and mudflats. The latter was the more important for feeding. The distribution of western sandpipers was constrained by seasonal tide levels as more habitat is available during fall migration. /// El noroeste de M{\'{e}}xico es considerado una de las {\'{a}}reas de invernaci{\'{o}}n m{\'{a}}s importantes para Calidris mauri.

abstract = {Tolerance to human disturbance can be estimated as the distance at which animals become noticeably alert to humans. Although this alert distance has been studied before, no consideration has been devoted to the relationship between vigilance behavior and the probabilities of detecting pedestrians. Our goal was to test whether and how differences in scanning behavior of two model species (spot-winged pigeon and eared dove) would affect the predicted and observed probabilities of detection of pedestrian approaches in two conditions: individuals foraging alone and in flocks. Overall, we found differences between species and between foraging conditions, but no interaction effects. Spot-winged pigeons and individuals foraging alone spent more time scanning, with longer scanning bout duration, than eared doves and individuals foraging in groups, respectively. Spot-winged pigeons showed greater alert distances (observed detection probabilities) than eared doves, and so did solitary individuals as compared to individuals foraging in groups. Greater scanning time may have increased predicted and observed detection probabilities of spot-winged pigeons. Expected probabilities of detection of pedestrian approaches were higher for group than for solitary foraging conditions, contrary to observed alert distances, probably due to a lack of collective detection in flocks. Our results suggest that vigilance behavior can affect the distance at which birds detect human disturbance and the estimation of tolerance. This behavioral effect could have implications in management scenarios (e.g. determining buffer areas), as similar levels of human visitation to protected areas may exert different effects according to the probabilities of detecting visitors within the detection windows of different species. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Nearly 20{\%} of all bird species migrate between breeding and nonbreeding sites annually. Their migrations include storied feats of endurance and physiology, from non-stop trans-Pacific crossings to flights at the cruising altitudes of jetliners. Despite intense interest in these performances, there remains great uncertainty about which factors most directly influence bird behaviour during migratory flights. We used GPS trackers that measure an individual{\&}{\#}039;s altitude and wingbeat frequency to track the migration of black-tailed godwits (Limosa limosa) and identify the abiotic factors influencing their in-flight migratory behaviour. We found that godwits flew at altitudes above 5000 m during 21{\%} of all migratory flights, and reached maximum flight altitudes of nearly 6000 m. The partial pressure of oxygen at these altitudes is less than 50{\%} of that at sea level, yet these extremely high flights occurred in the absence of topographical barriers. Instead, they were associated with high air temperatures at lower altitudes and increasing wind support at higher altitudes. Our results therefore suggest that wind, temperature and topography all play a role in determining migratory behaviour, but that their relative importance is context dependent. Extremely high-altitude flights may thus not be especially rare, but they may only occur in very specific environmental contexts.},

abstract = {Migrating Western Sandpipers, Calidris mauri (Cabanis, 1857), observed feeding at an intertidal stopover site on the Fraser River delta, British Columbia, shifted their foraging mode from surface-pecking to probing over a 3-week period in April and May. We tested possible mechanisms to account for the field observations. Using control and shorebird exclusion plots over a 3-month period bracketing the migration, we determined that neither seasonal nor shorebird-induced changes in the relative availability of epifaunal compared with infaunal prey accounted for the decline in the prevalence of epifaunal feeding behaviour. However, strong peaks in both epi- and in-faunal prey densities coincided with the migration period, suggesting that migratory timing may be linked with the productivity schedule of major stopover sites. Males, which precede females in the migration and have relatively shorter bills, were observed to engage in epifaunal feeding more frequently than females. Thus, while foraging behaviour of the Western Sandpiper at a population level appears "plastic", the feeding repertoire of individuals is more specialized and results in sexual partitioning of prey resources. The implications of our findings for differential distribution patterns over the nonbreeding range and sex-related differences in contaminant profiles are discussed.},

abstract = {The nonbreeding distribution of Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) was documented using 19 data sets from 13 sites along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the Americas. Western Sandpipers showed latitudinal segregation with regard to sex and age. Females wintered farther south than males. A "U" shaped pattern was found with respect to age, with juveniles occurring at higher proportions at both the northern and southern ends of the range. Distribution of sexes might be affected by differences in bill length and a latitudinal trend in depth distribution of prey. For age class distribution, two different life-history tactics of juveniles might exist that are related to the higher cost of feather wear for juveniles compared to adults. Most juveniles complete three long-distance migrations on one set of flight feathers whereas adults complete two. Juveniles may winter either far north, thereby reducing feather wear induced by ultraviolet light, migration, or both, or far south and spend the summer on the nonbreeding area.},

abstract = {WC studied habitat use of shorebirds (Charadriiformes) at a wetland experiencing natural fluctuations in water levels located at Tishomingo National Wildlife Refuge in the south-central Great Plains. We describe use of macrohabitats (disturbed, deciduous, snags, and mudflat) and microbabitats (dry-land, wet-land, and water) by foraging groups (terrestrial-aquatic gleaner, small aquatic prober-gleaner, aquatic gleaner). Water level was correlated with shorebird abundance. The small aquatic prober-gleaner group comprised 85.9{\%} of the total shorebird community. Shorebirds selected mudflat macrohabitats; (P {\textless} 0.05) and avoided disturbed, deciduous, and snags. All shorebird groups selected water microhabitat, except for the small aquatic prober-gleaner group that selected wet-land microhabitat (P {\textless} 0.05). There was a negative correlation (r(s) = -0.36, n = 58, P = 0.005) between pool level and number of shorebirds per survey. The relationship of water level and shorebird abundance may have more impact in an unmanaged wetland than managed wetlands. Tishomingo National Wildlife Refuge may be an important stopover site for small aquatic prober-gleaner species (e.g., western sandpipers, Calidris mauri) that require many stops along their migration routes.},

abstract = {Migrant birds have been trapped on the island of Helgoland (southeastern North Sea) since 1909, with methods and sampling effort remaining unchanged throughout the last four decades. In 12 short/medium–distance migrants and 12 long–distance migrants (23 passerines plus the European woodcock) sample sizes were sufficient to calculate mean spring passage (msp) times and to relate these to climate change. All but one species, passing Helgoland en route to their breeding areas (mainly in Scandinavia), show a trend towards earlier msp–time, which is significant in 7 short/medium–distance migrants and 10 long–distance migrants. The msp–times advanced by 0.05–0.28 days per year, short/medium–distance migrants not differing from long–distance migrants. In 23 out of the 24 species, earlier msp–times coincide with local warmer msp–temperatures (significantly in 11 and 7 species of the two groups, respectively). Even more striking is the relation to a large–scale phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), during the last four decades. Again, in 23 out of the 24 species, an earlier msp-time coincides with higher NAO indices (significantly in 9 and 12 species, respectively). The NAO index can also explain differences and similarities in spring migration strategies, as well as migration routes within Europe.},

abstract = {Broad-scale avian surveys have been attempted within North America with mixed results. Arid regions, such as the Great Basin, are often poorly sampled because of the vastness of the region, inaccessibility of sites, and few ornithologists. In addition, extreme variability in wetland habitat conditions present special problems for conducting censuses of species inhabiting these areas. We examined these issues in assessing multi-scale shorebird (order: Charadriiformes) censuses conducted in the western Great Basin from 1992-1997. On ground surveys, we recorded 31 species of shorebirds, but were unable to accurately estimate population size. Conversely, on aerial surveys we were able to estimate regional abundance of some shorebirds, but were unable to determine species diversity. Aerial surveys of three large alkali lakes in Oregon (Goose, Summer, and Abert Lakes) revealed {\textgreater} 300,000 shorebirds in one year of this study, of which 67{\%} were American Avocets (Recurvirostra americana) and 30{\%} phalaropes (Phalaropus spp.). These lakes clearly meet Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network guidelines for designation as important shorebird sites. Based upon simulations of our monitoring effort and the magnitude and variation of numbers of American Avocets, detection of 5-10{\%} negative declines in populations of these birds would take a minimum of 7-23 years of comparable effort. We conclude that a combination of ground and aerial surveys must be conducted at multiple sites and years and over a large region to obtain an accurate picture of the diversity, abundance, and trends of shorebirds in the western Great Basin.},

@article{MERCIER1994,
abstract = {We analyzed the relationship between the abundance of shorebirds and that of their intertidal invertebrate prey, and attempted to determine if shorebird predation significantly affects prey density. The study was conducted at three sites in the Chacopata Lagoon complex in northeastern Venezuela between January 1985 and September 1986, using shorebird census data, monthly sampling of intertidal invertebrates, and exclosure experiments. The invertebrates collected were divided into three groups: (i) polychaetes (less than or equal to 50 mm in length), (ii) small bivalves (2-3 mm in length), and (iii) other species. The overall density of shorebirds foraging in the Chacopata Lagoon complex was very high, exceeding the densities reported for most other staging and overwintering areas by a wide margin. The abundance of shorebirds in the study area was related primarily to the density of polychaetes, their main prey. At two of the study sites, the arrival of fall migrants followed a significant increase in polychaete numbers. The increase in shorebird numbers in autumn was negligible at the third site, where poly chaete density was lower than at the other sites. The impact of shorebird predation on their invertebrate prey varied seasonally, as did the extent of the foraging area available to them. The exclosure experiment revealed significant differences in the density of polychaetes inside and outside the exclosures only during, or shortly after, the fall migration period. The variability in the conclusions drawn from other studies examining prey depletion by shorebirds in tropical environments may be explained by differences in the length of sampling periods and seasonal variations in the numbers of foraging shorebirds, the energy demands of moult, fat deposition, and the intertidal surface area available for feeding. The impact of seasonal variables such as these should be taken into consideration when designing studies to measure prey depletion by shorebirds; such objectives may necessitate long-term studies.},

abstract = {In Arabic, as in many languages, the future is “ahead” and the past is “behind.” Yet in the research reported here, we showed that Arabic speakers tend to conceptualize the future as behind and the past as ahead of them, despite using spoken metaphors that suggest the opposite. We propose a new account of how space-time mappings become activated in individuals' minds and entrenched in their cultures, the temporal-focus hypothesis: People should conceptualize either the future or the past as in front of them to the extent that their culture (or subculture) is future oriented or past oriented. Results support the temporal-focus hypothesis, demonstrating that the space-time mappings in people's minds are conditioned by their cultural attitudes toward time, that they depend on attentional focus, and that they can vary independently of the space-time mappings enshrined in language.

abstract = {We describe stopover ecology for 132 migrant radiomarked Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) relocated repeatedly along the Pacific Flyway of North America. Eighty-eight percent of radiomarked birds were detected at 1-5 sites north of their banding sites, at distances ranging from 240-4,000 km away. We compare length of stay and physical indices of Western Sandpipers banded at coastal sites (San Francisco Bay, California and Grays Harbor, Washington), and an interior, western Great Basin site (Honey Lake, California). Western Sandpipers radiomarked at the interior site had significantly shorter length of stays than birds radiomarked at coastal sites, and they had significantly lower fat scores. The ephemeral nature of Great Basin stopover sites and an increased risk of predation may explain some of this variation. Fat and body condition indexes explained little of the observed variation in length of stay of Western Sandpipers at banding and other stopover sites. Length of stay of birds radiomarked at Grays Harbor were significantly longer compared to birds radiomarked to the south that also stopped at Grays Harbor, suggesting a potential capture effect on length of stay of birds at banding sites. Mean length of stays at seven sites other than banding sites ranged from 1.1-3.3 days and were not significantly affected by sex of bird, year of study, or banding location. Length of stay of male Western Sandpipers at the Copper River Delta, Alaska became significantly shorter later in the migration period, but not for females. Coastal sites along the Pacific Flyway from San Francisco to the breeding grounds generally function as stopovers for Western Sandpipers instead of staging areas.},

Although over a million shorebirds pass through Grays Harbor each spring, experimental data showed no significant depression of prey abundance for any of the sandflat invertebrates. Unlike better studied stop-over areas, Grays Harbor is not characterized by rich prey densities. The surprising lack of effects on prey abundance likely arises because these sandpipers do not need to deposit large fat stores to fuel their migration to their next stop-over area, the Fraser River delta in British Columbia, or the Copper River Delta in south-central Alaska. The effects of episodic predation by shorebirds appears to differ at different stop-over areas.},

abstract = {1. Risks of predation or interference competition are major factors shaping the distribution of species. An animal's response to risk can either be reactive, to an immediate risk, or predictive, based on preceding risk or past experiences. The manner in which animals respond to risk is key in understanding avoidance, and hence coexistence, between interacting species. 2. We investigated whether cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), known to be affected by predation and competition by lions (Panthera leo) and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta), respond reactively or predictively to the risks posed by these larger carnivores. 3. We used simultaneous spatial data from Global Positioning System (GPS) radiocollars deployed on all known social groups of cheetahs, lions and spotted hyaenas within a 2700 km(2) study area on the periphery of the Okavango Delta in northern Botswana. The response to risk of encountering lions and spotted hyaenas was explored on three levels: short-term or immediate risk, calculated as the distance to the nearest (contemporaneous) lion or spotted hyaena, long-term risk, calculated as the likelihood of encountering lions and spotted hyaenas based on their cumulative distributions over a 6-month period and habitat-associated risk, quantified by the habitat used by each of the three species. 4. We showed that space and habitat use by cheetahs was similar to that of lions and, to a lesser extent, spotted hyaenas. However, cheetahs avoided immediate risks by positioning themselves further from lions and spotted hyaenas than predicted by a random distribution. 5. Our results suggest that cheetah spatial distribution is a hierarchical process, first driven by resource acquisition and thereafter fine-tuned by predator avoidance; thus suggesting a reactive, rather than a predictive, response to risk.},

abstract = {Protandry, the earlier arrival of males than of females on breeding areas, occurs in many taxa, including many migratory birds. Numerous hypotheses have been generated to explain protandry. Using bird-banding records, I show that protogyny, the earlier migration of females, frequently occurs in the autumn, though it is less universal and less dramatic than spring protandry. In one species, it occurs in both hatch-year and adult birds. When (1) spring and autumn, (2) departures and arrivals, and (3) breeding and wintering ground conditions are considered, hypotheses generated only to explain spring protandry can be more thoroughly evaluated. Using that approach, the most parsimonious explanation of differential migration between the sexes explains earlier male arrival in spring and later male departure in autumn through either (1) indirect selection operating on intrasexual male competition for territories or (2) direct selection operating on intersexual relations requiring males to be present on breeding territories when females are present. In autumn-protogynous species, males may "play chicken," balancing the benefits of remaining longer than females and protecting territories for subsequent years against the costs of remaining in the north under deteriorating conditions and delaying the acquisition of a good winter territory.},

Long-term distribution records of 14 species or subspecies of migratory birds were used together with grey relationship analysis, fuzzy sets classification techniques, the consistency index and the attribution index. Over the past 50 years, edges of distributions expanded. Different species expanded to different directions driven directly by the climate change or driven secondary by the climate change or other habitat changes, and for the majority of birds, these changes were mainly related to the thermal index. Driven by climatic factors over the past years, the northern limits of more than one-half of the birds shifted northward with fluctuations. In addition, the consistency indices of observed vs. predicted changes in the distribution boundaries or the distribution centers were higher for particular migratory birds. The changes in the center latitude or longitude of the distribution of 4 species or subspecies, the northern boundary of 6 species or subspecies, the southern boundary of 1 subspecies, the eastern boundary of 5 species or subspecies and the western boundary of 3 species or subspecies can be attributed to climate change.},

abstract = {Variation in antipredation behavior should translate into variation in survival. Effective general defenses, such as predator avoidance, decrease the likelihood that an individual is attacked and should therefore reduce selection on behaviors that enhance probability of escape on attack. Escape behaviors become important if animals cannot avoid attack. We investigated the relative effects of avoidance and escape enhancing behaviors on the survival of juvenile redshanks, Tringa totanus, over 2 winters. We predicted that avoidance behavior should be the primary behavioral correlate of survival, but when forced, by starvation risk, into areas where risk of attack is much higher, behaviors that reduce risk of capture once attacked should also promote survival. We found that reducing exposure to attack was most important for increasing survival and that increased vigilance and foraging success rate only increased survival for individuals that spent more time in high-risk areas. Use of the high-risk area and survival varied between years, suggesting that variation in starvation risk (i.e., colder winters) may provide a mechanism for selection on "capture-reducing" antipredation behaviors to be maintained because predator avoidance, the most effective antipredation behavior, is not then possible.},

Because wetlands are spatially and temporally dynamic, shorebirds may accumulate highly variable lipid reserves. We compared lipid reserves among four shore-bird species (American Avocets [Recurvirostra americana], Long-billed Dowitchers [Limnodromus scolopaceus], Least Sandpipers [Calidris minutilla], and Western Sandpipers [C mauri]) collected from playa wetlands in the southern Great Plains during spring 1993 and 1994. Because playas are ephemeral, we had the opportunity to examine the influence of a variable environment (a wet year and a dry year) on lipid reserves. Additionally, we examined the influence of different migration distances and strategies, and body sizes on lipid reserves. Western Sandpipers had the highest lipid reserves (41{\%}-50{\%}) and Dowitchers had the lowest reserves (18{\%}). Least and Western Sandpipers had 7{\%}-9{\%} higher lipid reserves in the wet year than dry year. Thus, small-bodied shorebirds may be more affected by variable habitat conditions than large-bodied shorebirds because of their higher mass-specific metabolic rates.},

abstract = {Shorebirds seem to have evolved a number of strategies for adapting to and exploiting the unpredictable and inhospitable Arctic environment. Two such strategies put forth by Holmes and Pitelka suggest that species either conservatively or opportunistically select breeding locations based on local environmental conditions. ‘‘Conservative'' species were characterized by strong site fidelity and territoriality, consistent population densities, relatively even spacing of individuals, and monogamous mating systems, while ‘‘opportunistic'' species exhibited opposite traits and were polygamous. Here, we assessed whether 10 shorebird species consistently exhibited these settlement strategies over a 10-year period (2003–2012) near Barrow, Alaska, by comparing annual estimates of site fidelity, territoriality, and population density. Additionally, we determined the relative importance of past and current environmental and social conditions in predicting annual breeding densities of these same species. Data from 1,413 captured adults and 1,946 shorebird nests indicated that most species conformed to 1 of the 2 settlement strategies, while others exhibited traits of both strategies, and a few had settlement patterns inconsistent with that predicted for their mating system. We suggest that deviations from these strategies may occur depending on a species' location within its breeding range. For some species, however, described settlement patterns may be too simplistic. Species with the same settlement strategy seem to respond similarly to environmental cues but differently than species with the alternative strategy. However, we were unable to determine a common environmental cue for species with the same settlement strategy, although lemming abundance, overall nest survival rate, and presence of conspecifics or heterospecifics did seem to influence settlement decisions in some species. Results from this study indicate that understanding how species settle may have important consequences for implementing monitoring or conservation actions.},

abstract = {In foraging animals, visual scanning of the surrounding environment is referred to as vigilance and is commonly assumed to be aimed at potential predation threats. Vigilance levels have been shown to decrease with increases in group size. The decline in vigilance is usually interpreted as a response to the lower risk of predation in larger groups. Several mechanisms may be involved in the decline. Despite the apparent success of behavioural studies in documenting group-size effects on vigilance, two problems have beset interpretation of the results. The first problem is related to the cause of the decline in vigilance since mechanisms unrelated to predation risk may also produce decreases in vigilance without group size. The second problem is related to the nature of the decline in vigilance. Predation factors, such as dilution or detection effects, are expected to produce an asymptotic decrease in vigilance with group size. The purpose of this paper is to review recent theoretical and empirical research to understand the cause and the nature of changes in vigilance levels with group size with the ultimate view to assess the contribution of several mechanisms to the group-size effect.

abstract = {The behavioural rhythms of organisms are thought to be under strong selection, influenced by the rhythmicity of the environment1-4. Behavioural rhythms are well studied in isolated individuals under laboratory conditions1,5, but in free-living populations, individuals have to temporally synchronize their activities with those of others, including potential mates, competitors, prey and predators6-10. Individuals can temporally segregate their daily activities (e.g. prey avoiding predators, subordinates avoiding dominants) or synchronize their activities (e.g. group foraging, communal defence, pairs reproducing or caring for offspring)6,9-11. The behavioural rhythms that emerge from such social synchronization and the underlying evolutionary and ecological drivers that shape them remain poorly understood5-7,9. Here, we address this in the context of biparental care, a particularly sensitive phase of social synchronization12 where pair members potentially compromise their individual rhythms. Using data from 729 nests of 91 populations of 32 biparentally-incubating shorebird species, where parents synchronize to achieve continuous coverage of developing eggs, we report remarkable within- and between-species diversity in incubation rhythms. Between species, the median length of one parent′s incubation bout varied from one to 19 hours, while period length - the cycle of female and male probability to incubate - varied from six to 43 hours. The length of incubation bouts was unrelated to variables reflecting energetic demands, but species relying on crypsis had longer incubation bouts than those that are readily visible or actively protect their nest against predators. Rhythms entrainable to the 24-h light dark cycle were less likely at high latitudes and absent in 18 species. Our results indicate that even under similar environmental conditions and despite 24-h environmental cues, social synchronization can generate far more diverse behavioural rhythms than expected from studies of individuals in captivity5-7,9. The risk of predation, not the risk of starvation, may be a key factor underlying the diversity in these rhythms.},

abstract = {Arctic-nesting shorebirds require several refueling stops during their long migrations between breeding grounds and Central and South American wintering areas. The protection of stopover habitats for transcontinental migrants depends on whether birds fly long distances between a few select sites or fly short distances and stop at several wetlands. Although the Great Plains historically provided a vast array ofwetlands for use by migrants, wetland loss and conversion have reduced the availability of stopover sites in recent decades. In this study, we examined (1) residency periods, (2) fat dynamics, and (3) migration chronology of two shorebird species, the Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) and White-rumped Sandpiper (C. fuscicollis) at Quivira National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Kansas. Semipalmated Sandpipers had prolonged periods of species residency with overlapping arrivals and departures. Individual residency periods were highly variable and were unrelated to lipid reserves upon arrival. In contrast, White-rumped Sandpipers arrived and departed more synchronously. Birds that arrived in poor condition stayed longer than those with more body fat in 1991, but not in 1992. Wind direction did not influence patterns of departures of either species. We hypothesize that Semipalmated Sandpipers are ecologically eurytopic when migrating across the Great Plains in the spring. Highly variable patterns in arrival, residency, and lipid levels indicate that spring migration of this species is relaxed and opportunistic. White-rumped Sandpipers showed a pattern of reduced flexibility. Flight range estimates suggest that most birds require intermediate stopovers before reaching the breeding grounds. Interior wetlands appear to function as migration stopovers rather than staging areas for shorebirds.},

abstract = {A population decline of the western Atlantic red knot (Calidris canutus rufa) has been linked to food limitation during the spring migratory stopover in Dela- ware Bay, USA. The stopover ecology at potential alter- native sites has received little attention. We studied factors affecting red knot habitat selection and flock size at a coastal stopover site in Virginia in 2006–2007. The most common potential prey items were coquina clams (Donax variabilis) and crustaceans. Red knot foraging sites had more clams and crustaceans than unused sites in 2006. Prey abundance increased during the 2007 stopover period and remained high after the red knot peak. Red knot flock size in 2007 increased with mean clam shell length, and prob- ability of flock presence decreased with increasing distance from night use locations. Our results suggest that red knots preferred coquina clams and that these clams were not depleted during the stopover period in 2007. Thus prey abundance did not appear to be a population-limiting factor at this coastal stopover site in Virginia in that year. Pro- tection of coastal sites outside of Delaware Bay, many of which have been altered by human development, would likely benefit red knot population recovery, as they can apparently provide abundant food resources during at least some years.},

abstract = {Migratory decisions in birds are closely tied to environmental cues and fat stores, but it remains unknown if the same variables trigger bat migration. To learn more about the rare phenomenon of bat migration, we studied departure decisions of female common noctules (Nyctalus noctula) in southern Germany. We did not find the fattening period that modulates departure decisions in birds. Female noctules departed after a regular evening foraging session, uniformly heading northeast. As the day of year increased, migratory decisions were based on the interactions among wind speed, wind direction and air pressure. As the migration season progressed, bats were likely to migrate on nights with higher air pressure and faster tail winds in the direction of travel, and also show high probability of migration on low-pressure nights with slow head winds. Common noctules thus monitor complex environmental conditions to find the optimal migration night.},

abstract = {Sympatric speciation, the formation of species in the absence of geographical barriers, remains one of the most contentious concepts in evolutionary biology. Although speciation under sympatric conditions seems theoretically possible, empirical studies are scarce and only a few credible examples of sympatric speciation exist. Here we present a convincing case of sympatric speciation in the Midas cichlid species complex (Amphilophus sp.) in a young and small volcanic crater lake in Nicaragua. Our study includes phylogeographic, population-genetic (based on mitochondrial DNA, microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphisms), morphometric and ecological analyses. We find, first, that crater Lake Apoyo was seeded only once by the ancestral high-bodied benthic species Amphilophus citrinellus, the most common cichlid species in the area; second, that a new elongated limnetic species (Amphilophus zaliosus) evolved in Lake Apoyo from the ancestral species (A. citrinellus) within less than approximately 10,000 yr; third, that the two species in Lake Apoyo are reproductively isolated; and fourth, that the two species are eco-morphologically distinct.},

abstract = {Populations of many bird species strongly declined in Western Europe in the late twentieth century. One such species is the Red-backed Shrike in the Netherlands. In one of the last strongholds of this spe- cies, the Bargerveen Reserve, the breeding population flourished in the 1990s due to rewetting management. However, further development of the area has led to adecline in breeding numbers such that the population is now less than half the size it was in the 1990s. Here, we analyze the vital rates of the Red-backed Shrike popu- lation in the Bargerveen. In 2001–2008, nestlings in this population were individually marked, and resighting data was collected during the breeding seasons of 2002–2009. We used estimates of vital rates based on monitoring in 2001 until 2009 to diagnose the population dynamics. Mark–recapture data were analyzed with the program MARK. The most parsimonious model gave age- and gender-specific survival probabilities of 0.12 for first-year females, 0.64 for older females, 0.20 for first-year males, and 0.54 for older males (with overlapping confidence intervals for the gender-specific adult survival values). The estimated yearly resighting probabilities were gender specific, with a higher probability observed for males (0.81) than for females (0.53). For 2001–2009, we computed an average number of offspring per breeding pair of 2.91 (with 72 {\%} of the pairs breeding success- fully). Using these vital rates, we parameterized a simple matrix model. The resulting yearly growth was 0.80. Adult survival had an elasticity of 0.83, while juvenile survival and reproduction both had an elasticity of 0.20. Because the population numbers have stabilized since 2005, the observed yearly population growth suggests that 20 {\%} of the Red-backed Shrikes breeding in the Bargerveen are immigrants. Comparison with data on other Red-backed Shrike populations indicates that juvenile and adult survival rates can be improved in the Bargerveen Reserve. Appropriate management measures to accomplish this are discussed.},

abstract = {Recent shifts in phenology in response to climate change are well established but often poorly understood. Many animals integrate climate change across a spatially and temporally dispersed annual life cycle, and effects are modulated by ecological interactions, evolutionary change and endogenous control mechanisms. Here we assess and discuss key statements emerging from the rapidly developing study of changing spring phenology in migratory birds. These well-studied organisms have been instrumental for understanding climate-change effects, but research is developing rapidly and there is a need to attack the big issues rather than risking affirmative science. Although we agree poorly on the support for most claims, agreement regarding the knowledge basis enables consensus regarding broad patterns and likely causes. Empirical data needed for disentangling mechanisms are still scarce, and consequences at a population level and on community composition remain unclear. With increasing knowledge, the overall support ('consensus view') for a claim increased and between-researcher variability in support ('expert opinions') decreased, indicating the importance of assessing and communicating the knowledge basis. A proper integration across biological disciplines seems essential for the field's transition from affirming patterns to understanding mechanisms and making robust predictions regarding future consequences of shifting phenologies.},

abstract = {Places where migrant birds stop to rest, drink, and eat at are often described as either stopover or staging sites. Attempts have been made to differentiate between these two terms but they are frequently used interchangeably. Some authors have equated staging sites with sites that attract large concentrations (many thousands) of birds, a definition that others have expanded to include long stopover durations and significant rates of refueling on predictable, abundant prey. It has also been suggested that birds using staging sites are those that employ a jumping strategy during migration. I argue that while all sites where birds rest and feed during migration are stopover sites, further classification of stopover sites is of ecological and conservation value. I propose that sites with abundant, predictable food resources where birds prepare for an energetic challenge (usually a long flight over a barrier such as an ocean or a desert) requiring substantial fuel stores and physiological changes without which significant fitness costs are incurred are most appropriately described as staging sites.},

abstract = {Population sex ratios in monogamous birds are often male biased. One factor that can affect population sex ratios is sex-biased predation. However, most estimates of sex-biased predation in birds have focused on species with obvious sexual colour dimorphism or body size dimorphism. Data on sexually monomorphic birds are generally lacking. In the present study, we adopt a PCR-based sexing procedure to help test for sex-biased predation in a wintering population of western sandpipers (Calidris mauri), a shorebird that shows only subtle sexual size dimorphism. Specifically, by comparing the a priori determined sex ratio of live birds wintering at a site in western Mexico to the molecular estimate obtained from depredated birds at this same site, we were able to perform a population-specific test for sex bias in predator-induced mortality. The proportion of females estimated from living (ca. 25{\%}) versus dead (ca. 24{\%}) individuals was in fact not significantly different, indicating that the strong male bias in this population is not due to differential predation. However, molecular sexing of prey remains is a hitherto unexploited test of sex-biased predation in birds, and is potentially applicable to any species for which prey remains can be gathered. We discuss our results in the context of alternate ecological hypotheses for population sex biases.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. The shape of the function linking predator-attack success rate with distance to predator-concealing cover, or prey refuge, will affect population dynamics, distribution patterns and community trophic structure. Theory predicts that predator-attack success should decline exponentially with distance from predator-concealing cover, resulting in a threshold distance value above which there is little change in risk. Animals should then completely avoid areas of otherwise suitable habitat below this threshold, except when starvation risk exceeds predation risk. 2. We measured the shape of the function linking attack success with distance from cover in a system of Eurasian Sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus attacking (n = 445) and killing (n = 71) Redshanks Tringa totanus. We then determined if there was a threshold value and whether redshanks avoided areas below this threshold. 3. Sparrowhawk success rate with distance to predator-concealing cover declined exponentially with a threshold value of approximately 30 m. Redshanks used habitat above the threshold according to profitability and only fed below it, on average, in cold weather when starvation risk can be imminently high. Above about 5 degrees C, 26{\%} of available habitat was avoided. 4. Our data support the hypothesis that predators create discrete areas with respect to cover that are avoided by prey. Large areas of suitable habitat may be unused, except in times of high starvation risk, when such areas may provide a foraging reserve, with large implications for population distribution and dynamics. 5. Our results are generated from a system in which predators attack their prey from concealing cover. But in the theoretically identical reverse scenario where the prey animal's distance from protective cover determines predation risk, such non-lethal effects will be equally important, especially in heavily fragmented landscapes.},

abstract = {Whether predators always attack the most vulnerable prey or simply attack prey that exceeds a minimum vulnerability level is an important question to answer in furthering our understanding of predator and antipredation behaviour. Predators may attack any reasonably vulnerable prey rather than waste time identifying the most vulnerable prey, particularly when prey can respond quickly to alter their vulnerability in response to a predator. We tested whether sparrowhawks always choose to attack the group of prey that maximises their capture probability, or whether they simply attack any group above a minimum vulnerability. We modelled sparrowhawk attack success when hunting redshanks using data from three winters and found that probability of capture increased when group size or distance to predator-concealing cover decreased. We then used this model to predict the relative vulnerability to capture of redshank groups occurring in pairs in a fourth winter and found that sparrowhawks attacked the most vulnerable prey group twice as often as not (66{\%} n=59 pairs). When sparrowhawks attacked the less vulnerable group, there was no tendency for both groups to be particularly vulnerable or for the difference in the vulnerability between the two groups to be relatively small. This suggests that, while sparrowhawks do on average attack the most vulnerable group available, they consider other factors that affect vulnerability or that additional factors lead them to also attack opportunistically. This suggests that there will be selection for the predator to monitor a large number of prey individuals and groups and for prey to have the ability to monitor the behaviour of conspecifics in the same and different groups so that they can assess relative vulnerability.},

Specifically, we analyzed data from a reintroduced population wherein all birds were captive bred and artificially trained by ultralight aircraft on their first lifetime migration. For subsequent migrations, in which birds fly individually or in groups but without ultralight escort, we found evidence of long-term social learning, but no effect of genetic relatedness on migratory performance. Social learning from older birds reduced deviations from a straight-line path, with 7 years of experience yielding a 38{\%} improvement in migratory accuracy.},

This project assessed opinions about computer models in general and attitudes about a specific model being used in water planning in the Middle Rio Grande Region of New Mexico, United States. More than 1000 individuals were surveyed about their perceptions of computer-based models in general. Additionally, more than 150 attendees at public meetings related to the Middle Rio Grande planning effort were surveyed about their perceptions of the specific Rio Grande-based model. The results reveal that the majority of respondents are confident in their ability to understand models and most believe that models are appropriate tools for education and for making policy decisions. Responses also reveal that trust in who develops a model is a key issue related to public support. Regarding the specific model highlighted in this project, the public revealed tremendous support for its usefulness as a public engagement tool as well as a tool to assist decision-makers in regional water planning. Although indicating broad support for models, the results do raise questions about the role of trust in using models in contentious decisions.},

abstract = {The effects of relative fuel load on migration speed and on vulnerability have been investigated, but the effects of seasonal variation in predation danger on the amount of fuel and duration of stopover have not been considered. We analyzed seasonal patterns of stopover residence times for western and semipalmated sandpipers Calidris mauri and C. pusilla on southward migration in relation to the passage of migratory peregrine falcons Falco peregrinus. We predicted that individuals on stopover far in advance of the seasonal arrival of falcons would adjust stopover length and hence relative fuel load to migrate slowly and cautiously. We predicted that individuals on stopover later in the season would increase migratory speed as the arrival of migratory falcons came closer, while individuals on stopover under or behind the passage of falcons would migrate slowly. Adult and juvenile semipalmated and adult western sandpipers migrated prior to seasonal increases in peregrine abundance, and as predicted, the seasonal patterns of their stopover durations are consistent with an increase in the speed of migration as the date of peregrine arrival approached. Juvenile western sandpipers, in contrast, migrating concurrently with falcons, slowed their speed of migration as predator abundance increased. Stopover patterns differ between species due to different relative fuel loads. The results fit predictions made based on a mortality-minimizing migration strategy.},

abstract = {The number of studies investigating links between among-individual differences in metabolic rate (MR) and behavior has grown dramatically in the past several years. A major and often untested assumption of these studies is that the selected measure of MR is a valid proxy for energetic constraints. We argue that without explicitly testing this assumption, observed patterns between MR and behavior are uninterpretable. We provide guidelines for evaluating how a given measure of MR relates to constraints on the acquisition or expenditure of energy. The approach we advocate will allow researchers to develop and test a priori predictions relating energy metabolism and behavior. We conclude by highlighting several exciting directions for future work in this rapidly growing field.},

The evolution and proximate control of these alternatives are only beginning to be understood. Although game theory has provided a theoretical framework, the concept of the mixed strategy has not been realized in nature, and alternative strategies are very rare. Recent findings suggest that almost all alternative reproductive phenotypes within the sexes are due to alternative tactics within a conditional strategy, and, as such, while the average fitnesses of the alternative phenotypes are unequal, the strategy is favoured in evolution. Proximate mechanisms that underlie alternative phenotypes may have many similarities with those operating between the sexes.},

abstract = {The acquisition of body reserves by migrating shorebirds at specific staging sites is critical for reaching their breeding or wintering grounds. As many North American shorebird populations are declining, major staging sites need to be identified for effective conservation plans. Changes in body mass of Semipalmated Plover (Charadrius semipalmatus Bonaparte, 1825) and Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla (L., 1766)) juveniles, as well as length of stay and daily movements by Semipalmated Plover juveniles during fall migration, were studied in the St. Lawrence River Estuary in southern Quebec, Canada. Most juveniles of both species captured early in the migration period weighed less than the estimated mean fat-free mass. Body mass increased steadily in juveniles of both species during staging. Mean body masses of birds captured in our study area were similar to or higher than those of juveniles of both species captured along the North Atlantic coast. Length of stay of radio-tracked Semipalmated Plover juveniles ranged from 2 to 28 days. Body mass at capture and length of stay were negatively associated, suggesting that individuals refuelled before resuming their migration. Overall, these results provide evidence that the St. Lawrence River Estuary is an important staging site for Semipalmated Plover and Semipalmated Sandpiper juveniles.},

abstract = {Bcakground:  A recent genome-wide association study for type 2 diabetes in Han Chinese identified several novel genetic variants. We investigated their associations with quantitative measures to explore the mechanism by which these variants influence glucose homeostasis. We also examined whether these variants predict progression to diabetes in a large prospective family-based Chinese cohort. Methods:  Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the PTPRD, SRR, MAF/WWOX, and KCNQ1 genes were genotyped in 1,138 subjects of Chinese origin from the Stanford Asia-Pacific Program for Hypertension and Insulin Resistance (SAPPHIRe) study. Results:  At baseline, the risk-conferring rs7192960 C allele near the MAF/WWOX genes was associated with lower homeostasis model assessment of $\beta$-cell (HOMA-$\beta$)(P=0.01) and second-phase insulin response in oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (P=0.04). The risk-conferring rs2237897 C alleles in the KCNQ1 gene were associated with higher fasting glucose (P=0.009), lower HOMA-$\beta$(P=0.03), and lower first-phase insulin response in OGTT (P=0.03). Over an average follow-up period of 5.43 years, participants with the risk-conferring rs17584499 TT genotype in the PTPRD gene were more likely to progress from non-diabetes to diabetes than were non-carriers (hazard ratio: 8.82, P=4×10(-5) ). The risk-conferring T allele in the PTPRD gene was associated with greater increase in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (P=0.04) over time. PTPRD gene expression in human adipose tissues was negatively associated with fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR. Conclusion:  Genetic variants near the KCNQ1 and MAF/WWOX genes are associated with reduced insulin secretion. The PTPRD genetic variant appears to be associated with progression to diabetes in Han Chinese, most likely through increased insulin resistance.},

abstract = {Sexual segregation outside the mating season is common in vertebrates. This has been shown to arise through resource partitioning in a number of taxa, but never in avian migrants. Western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) are migratory shorebirds that mainly breed in Alaska and overwinter along the coast in western and eastern North America down into South America. Females are slightly larger than males but have substantially longer bills. They migrate further south, resulting in a latitudinal bias in sex ratio. Resource partitioning could contribute to this pattern if (1) males and females forage on invertebrates buried at different sediment depths, and if (2) average prey burying depth changes with latitude. In accordance with the hypothesis, it was shown that female western sandpipers used a probing foraging mode more than males. Comparison of individuals overwintering in California, Mexico and Panama revealed that length of tarsus did not change among sites, while bill length increased in both males and females towards the south. Bill length residuals, corrected for length of tarsus, were also larger at a southern site. Between and within sexes, individuals with longer bills are thought to be favoured at southern latitudes because of a postulated general increase in invertebrate burying depth with higher ambient temperatures at lower latitudes. The implications of these findings for the evolution of sexual bill size dimorphism in shorebirds are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

As many North American shorebird populations are declining, major staging sites need to be identified for effective conservation plans. Changes in body mass of Semipalmated Plover (Charadrius semipalmatus Bonaparte, 1825) and Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla (L., 1766)) juveniles, as well as length of stay and daily movements by Semipalmated Plover juveniles during fall migration, were studied in the St. Lawrence River Estuary in southern Quebec, Canada. Most juveniles of both species captured early in the migration period weighed less than the estimated mean fat-free mass. Body mass increased steadily in juveniles of both species during staging. Mean body masses of birds captured in our study area were similar to or higher than those of juveniles of both species captured along the North Atlantic coast.

abstract = {Census data on endangered species are often sparse, error-ridden, and confined to only a segment of the population. Estimating trends and extinction risks using this type of data presents numerous difficulties. In particular, the estimate of the variation in year-to-year transitions in population size (the "process error" caused by stochasticity in survivorship and fecundities) is confounded by the addition of high sampling error variation. In addition, the year-to-year variability in the segment of the population that is sampled may be quite different from the population variability that one is trying to estimate. The combined effect of severe sampling error and age- or stage-specific counts leads to severe biases in estimates of population-level parameters. I present an estimation method that circumvents the problem of age- or stage-specific counts and is markedly robust to severe sampling error. This method allows the estimation of environmental variation and population trends for extinction-risk analyses using corrupted census counts-a common type of data for endangered species that has hitherto been relatively unusable for these analyses.},

abstract = {Animal-vehicle collisions cause high levels of vertebrate mortality worldwide, and what goes wrong when animals fail to escape and ultimately collide with vehicles is not well understood. We investigated alert and escape behaviours of captive brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) in response to virtual vehicle approaches of different sizes and at speeds ranging from 60 to 360 km h(-1). Alert and flight initiation distances remained similar across vehicle speeds, and accordingly, alert and flight initiation times decreased at higher vehicle speeds. Thus, avoidance behaviours in cowbirds appeared to be based on distance rather than time available for escape, particularly at 60-150 km h(-1); however, at higher speeds (more than or equal to 180 km h(-1)) no trend in response behaviour was discernible. As vehicle speed increased, cowbirds did not have enough time to assess the approaching vehicle, and cowbirds generally did not initiate flight with enough time to avoid collision when vehicle speed exceeded 120 km h-1. Although potentially effective for evading predators, the decision-making process used by cowbirds in our study appears maladaptive in the context of avoiding fast-moving vehicles. Our methodological approach and findings provide a framework to assess how novel management strategies could affect escape rules, and the sensory and cognitive abilities animals use to avoid vehicle collisions.},

abstract = {Abstract: We examined age- and sex-related differences in the timing of Wilson's Warbler (Wilsonia pusilla pileolata) migration at four locations in Alaska: Fairbanks, Tok, Mother Goose Lake, and Yakutat. We captured Wilson's Warblers with mist nets for {\textgreater}= 5 years during spring (northbound) and autumn (southbound) migration. In spring, males passed through our two northernmost sites-Tok and Fairbanks-earlier than females. During autumn, timing of adult migration did not differ by sex, but immatures passed through earlier than adults at all four sites. During previous studies of autumn passage sampled at lower latitudes, the lack of age-related differences in migration timing could be attributed to adults migrating faster than immatures (i.e., if immatures from higher latitudes began migration earlier than the adults, then the adults may have caught up to them at lower latitudes) or to the mixing of breeding populations from different locales. Autumn migration of adults and immatures netted at our two southernmost sites, both coastal locations, preceded migration at our two interior sites. These site-specific differences in the timing of autumn migration are likely the result of our coastal stations sampling birds that breed farther south and arrive earlier than birds breeding in more northerly regions of Alaska (and sampled at our interior stations). Early-arriving populations are likely able to complete their breeding season activities earlier and, subsequently, initiate their autumn migration earlier.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Clarification of the role of mangrove root structures as shelter from predators for benthic animals was investigated by considering (1) the impact of predation on benthic faunal communities in a mangrove forest as indicated by a predator exclusion experiment, and (2) the uses and effects of mangrove root structures by benthic animals under laboratory conditions. In the exclusion experiment, three treatments (predator exclusion cages, partial cages and un-caged controls) were established on surface substrates in each of 3 microhabitats (tidal creek, mangrove cover present and mangrove cover absent) in a Rhizophora mangrove forest in Southern Thailand. After 1 month, benthic invertebrates were sampled and comparisons made of their species' richness, abundance and biomass among the treatments. Laboratory experiments were undertaken in tanks containing artificial mangrove roots, using 2 dominant crab species (Perisesarma indiarum and Uca bengali) as prey and the barred mudskipper Periophthalmus argentilineatus as predator. Crab preference for root structure and predation rates were recorded. Predator exclusion from the mangrove area resulted in enhanced species' richness, abundance and biomass of benthic invertebrates in all microhabitats, including those with mangrove roots. However, the partial cage treatment did not change such characteristics, indicating that the artificial cage itself did not affect the animals. The laboratory experiments demonstrated that crab preferences for root structures were not influenced by predator presence, and that root structures did not reduce crab predation rates. Such process of dominant species might be cause for significant predation in field benthic community. The overall results indicated that predation was significant for species' richness, abundance and biomass of benthic mangrove forest communities, and vertical root structures did not necessarily provide effective shelter for benthic animals.

abstract = {We investigated which variables, including environmental variables and food availability, could predict the spatial distribution and dynamics of benthic macrofauna on an intertidal flat. A time series of macrobenthos and sediment grain size samples was complemented by time series of microphytobenthos and saltmarsh vegetation biomass and sediment grain size from airborne hyperspectral remote sensing, and elevation from laser altimetry. Response models were constructed to predict biomass and species richness of macrobenthos as a function of the environmental variables. Total biomass and species richness was best predicted by a combination of microphytobenthos biomass and sediment characteristics as explanatory variables. Deep deposit feeders and surface deposit feeders also responded best to a combination of variables, with deep deposit feeders responding more strongly to sediment grain size and surface deposit feeders responding more strongly to microphytobenthos biomass. The environmental conditions to reach maximum biomass differed for each macrobenthos species. Application of the response models to the remote sensing-derived maps of the environmental variables enabled significant predictions of the spatial distribution of macrobenthos biomass, demonstrating the differences in distribution of the macrobenthos species. The models also revealed the sensitivity of the macrobenthic community to environmental change. In situ and remote sensing data demonstrated a significant fining of the sediment and a (temporal) increase in average microphytobenthos biomass. Field observations also showed a significant increase in species richness and changes in the relative abundance of species, with a decrease in Bathyporeia pilosa, and an increase in Nereis diversicolor, Pygospio elegans and Heteromastus filiformis. Such changes in macrobenthos biomass and species richness were indeed predicted from the response models. The study demonstrates that the synoptic remote sensing techniques combined with field sampling allow efficient ecological mapping and monitoring.},

In this paper we investigate the effect of an induced time-constraint on the moult of Lesser Whitethroats Sylvia curruca. The time-constraint was induced through a shift in light regime large enough to transfer the birds to a date when, under normal conditions, they already should have started moulting. Time-constrained birds moulted faster and also grew shorter wing feathers, resulting in a shorter wing, compared to control birds. Only one individual responded by interrupting moult and retained a number of inner primaries unmoulted. The observed adjustments of moult, and the higher fuel loads towards the end of moult, are consistent with the ideas that time is an important factor in bird migration, affecting not only migration but also the events preceding it},

Shorebirds are excellent model organisms for understanding ecological, behavioural and evolutionary processes and are often used as indicators of wetland health. A global team of experienced shorebird researchers identified 45 issues facing these shorebird populations, and divided them into three categories (natural, current anthropogenic and future issues). The natural issues included megatsunamis, volcanoes and regional climate changes, while current anthropogenic threats encompassed agricultural intensification, conversion of tidal flats and coastal wetlands by human infrastructure developments and eutrophication of coastal systems. Possible future threats to shorebirds include microplastics, new means of recreation and infectious diseases. We suggest that this review process be broadened to other taxa to aid the identification and ranking of current and future conservation actions.},

We highlight how these threats have affected the conservation status and ecological functioning of the 31 largest mammalian carnivores on Earth. Consistent with theory, empirical studies increasingly show that large carnivores have substantial effects on the structure and function of diverse ecosystems. Significant cascading trophic interactions, mediated by their prey or sympatric mesopredators, arise when some of these carnivores are extirpated from or repatriated to ecosystems. Unexpected effects of trophic cascades on various taxa and processes include changes to bird, mammal, invertebrate, and herpetofauna abundance or richness; subsidies to scavengers; altered disease dynamics; carbon sequestration; modified stream morphology; and crop damage. Promoting tolerance and coexistence with large carnivores is a crucial societal challenge that will ultimately determine the fate of Earth's largest carnivores and all that depends upon them, including humans.},

abstract = {Population models show that the response of migratory bird populations to a reduction in the area, or change in the quality, of their winter feeding areas depends critically on the shape (linear or non-linear) and strength (slope) of the relationship describing how the proportion dying from starvation changes with population density. Yet the parameters that define such density-dependent functions are extremely difficult to estimate from direct measurements of mortality at different population sizes. Even if they could be estimated, there would be uncertainty as to whether or not the relationship would remain the same, and thus provide reliable predictions, in the new circumstances for which forecasts are required. This paper summarizes studies of the Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus which aim to derive the shape and strength of the winter density-dependent mortality and emigration function for one estuary, under existing and new circumstances, from the responses of individual birds to each other and to their spatially and seasonally varying food supply. Based on these studies, an individuals-based, physiologically structured game theoretic distribution model has been built which predicts the carrying capacity and numbers of birds dying at different population sizes. The model also can be applied to Oyster-catchers occupying several estuaries distributed throughout their wintering range and can thus be extended to the entire biogeographical or global population. In addition, it can be used to identify some easily measured behavioural and ecological parameters that identify those species, from a wide range of taxa, that are most likely to be affected by habitat loss and change.},

Dunlin are plumage monomorphic, so we used a maximum likelihood model to estimate overall and monthly sex ratios for each population based on culmen length distributions. Sex ratios in the Fraser River Delta were corrected for sex differences in habitat use. Monthly sex ratios were similar at the two sites but varied throughout the winter, likely reflecting differences in seasonal movement patterns between the sexes. Both populations showed an overall bias toward males (Fraser = 61{\%} males, Bolinas = 65{\%} males). Since there is no evidence to support the possibility of a skew toward males in C. a. pac...},

abstract = {Dear Mr. President-Elect, It may surprise you to learn that among the issues that will occupy much of your time in the coming years is one you barely mentioned during the campaign: food. Food policy is not something American presidents have had to give much thought to, at least since the Nixon administration -- the last time high food prices presented a serious political peril. Since then, federal policies to promote maximum production of the commodity crops (corn, soybeans, wheat and rice) from which most of our supermarket foods are derived have succeeded impressively in keeping prices low and food more or less off the national political agenda. But with a suddenness that has taken us all by surprise, the era of cheap and abundant food appears to be drawing to a close. What this means is that you, like so many other leaders through history, will find yourself confronting the fact -- so easy to overlook these past few years -- that the health of a nation's food system is a critical issue of national security. Food is about to demand your attention. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

abstract = {We investigated the influence of soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) burial depth on red rock crab (Cancer productus) foraging behaviour. In laboratory tanks, crabs searched for and excavated clams buried at depths of 5, 10, and 15 cm. Handling time of prey was partitioned into excavation time, breaking time, and eating time. Prey excavation formed 23{\%} of mean total handling time (mean 8.2 min total 35.7 min(-1)) at 5 cm prey depth, 62{\%} at 10 cm depth (mean 49.3 min total 79.5 min(-1)), and 73{\%} at 15 cm depth (mean 93.5 min total 128.2 min(-1)). Mean excavation time for clams increased at a rate of 8.3 min cm(-1) of depth; clam profitability (energy intake per unit handling time (J s(-1))) decreased with burial depth. Predation rates decreased with prey burial depth. Often crabs gave up attempts to excavate a clam, and abandonment frequency and excavation time before abandonment increased significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) with burial depth. Our findings confirm earlier studies which indicate that burial depth affords an important refuge from crab predation, significantly increasing prey handling time and decreasing the profitability of individual prey.

@article{Sutherland2013a,
abstract = {Roberts Bank, part of the Fraser River delta system on Canada's Pacific coast, is a dynamic estuarine environment supporting important fisheries as well as internationally significant populations of migratory shorebirds. The 8000. ha bank environment comprises a complex of riparian boundaries, intertidal marshes, mud and sand flats, eelgrass meadows, macroalgae and biofilms. Anthropogenic developments (a ferry causeway in 1961 and a port causeway in 1969) have been responsible for changes in tidal flow patterns, tidal elevation, sediment transport and the net expansion of eelgrass beds. The goals of the present study were to (1) directly compare geotechnical properties spanning each side of the coalport causeway, and (2) enhance our understanding of the intercauseway ecosystem under a high-resolution sampling design. Sediment properties (grain size, porosity, organic content, and chlorophyll) and biological communities (eelgrass, macrofauna (0.5-1.0. mm) and meiofauna (0.063-0.5. mm)) were surveyed in 1997 at three stations outside the intercauseway area and three lateral transects spanning the intercauseway tidal flat at tidal heights representing three different habitats: biofilm, Zostera japonica, and Zostera marina. A fine-silt organic-rich porous deposit was observed on the shoreward north side of the coalport causeway relative to the south counterpart, suggesting that consolidation and erosion processes could likely not keep pace with the deposition of Fraser River silt. High chlorophyll levels were found in the protected shoreward northern border of the ferry causeway where fine sands dominate and higher water transparency exists, owing to the redirection of the silt-laden river plume by the coalport causeway. Principle Components Analysis revealed a positive relationship between these porous, organic-rich sediments and cumacean abundance in all regions where eelgrass was absent, including the north side of the coalport causeway. Further, a positive relationship was found between biofilm components (chlorophyll and silt), polydora, and harpacticoid copepod abundance, which, together with cumaceans, are food for Western Sandpipers, Calidris mauri. Finally, 52{\%} of the intercauseway variation was explained by direct correlations between eelgrass attributes and fauna consisting of bivalves, caprellids, and harpacticoid copepods (root biomass, leaf area index), the latter being prey for juvenile salmon which depend on eelgrass beds as rearing habitat. These habitats are vulnerable to changes in tidal flow patterns, tidal elevation, sediment transport, and water clarity that could be caused by future port development and/or sea level rise in response to climate change. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

@article{Micheli1997,
abstract = {This study links spatial and seasonal patterns of mortality of the hard clam, Mercenaria mercenaria (L.), in marine soft bottoms with the predation rates and habitat use of its main predator, the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus Rathbun. Patterns of predation on tethered juvenile clams exposed to the natural assemblage of predators were compared among different habitat types in fall and summer. Between-habitat patterns of predation on clams varied with season. In fall, predation on tethered clams was greater in subtidal sand bottoms and just inside the edge of intertidal salt marshes than in intertidal sand hats. In summer, predation on clams was similar in all habitats. Experiments conducted in held enclosures showed that: (a) individual crabs spent more time in the salt marsh habitat than in intertidal sand flats; (b) crab individuals placed in a sand bottom habitat had greater predation rates in high-density prey patches than in low-density patches; (c) individuals had greater predation rates in prey patches located just inside the edge of salt marshes than in intertidal sand flats, when prey density was held constant between the two habitats; (d) at intermediate and high crab densities predation mortality of clams was similar between vegetated and unvegetated habitats; (e) both individual crabs and groups of crabs consumed similar numbers of clams in the two habitat types when large predatory birds (mainly various species of terns, Sterna spp., herring gulls, Larus argentatus Coues, and ring-billed gulls, L. delawarensis Ord) were excluded from enclosures, but the crabs consumed more clams in the salt marsh than in the sand flat habitat in control enclosures where birds were not excluded. In the fall, when Herring and Ring-billed Gulls were abundant in the study area, preference by blue crabs for safer and more profitable habitats may explain the greater predation on clams in salt marshes than in intertidal sand flats. In the summer, when Herring and Ring-billed Gulls were rare and crab densities are 1.5-3 times greater than in the fall, competition with conspecifics may have caused crabs to disperse and feed in intertidal flats and may explain the general lack of differences in predation intensity among habitat types observed in the summer. Thus, patterns of predation and habitat use by blue crabs appeared to explain between-habitat and seasonal differences in predation mortality of clams. Focusing on the variation in the feeding rates of individual predators in response to external conditions can produce the mechanistic understanding of spatial and seasonal patterns of predation needed to understand and better predict the processes that structure benthic marine communities.},

abstract = {Accurate measurements of prey availability are vital to our understanding of foraging behaviour, particularly prey selectivity. In the present study, observations of shorebirds foraging for fiddler crabs on intertidal mudflats demonstrate that prey availability depends both on the temporal variation in crab activity and on the crabs' responses to the presence of foraging shorebirds. Our results suggest that measurements of prey availability that do not specifically account for prey activity patterns and their responses to predators are neccessarily inaccurate. Furthermore, our results also show that tests for foraging selectivity are extremely sensitive to the way in which prey availability is measured and can even indicate active prey selectivity when more accurate measures of prey availability show predators to be non-selective. Because inaccurate measures of food resources greatly reduce our ability to detect food preferences, greater care must be taken to account for prey activity patterns and their responses to predators in measurements of prey availability.

abstract = {Motivated by data demonstrating fluctuating relative and absolute fitnesses for white- versus blue-flowered morphs of the desert annual Linanthus parryae, we present conditions under which temporally fluctuating selection and fluctuating contributions to a persistent seed bank will maintain a stable single-locus polymorphism. In L. parryae, blue flower color is determined by a single dominant allele. To disentangle the underlying diversity-maintaining mechanism from the mathematical complications associated with departures from Hardy-Weinberg genotype frequencies and dominance, we successively analyze a haploid model, a diploid model with three distinguishable genotypes, and a diploid model with complete dominance. For each model, we present conditions for the maintenance of a stable polymorphism, then use a diffusion approximation to describe the long-term fluctuations associated with these polymorphisms. Our protected polymorphism analyses show that a genotype whose arithmetic and geometric mean relative fitnesses are both less than one can persist if its relative fitness exceeds one in years that produce the most offspring. This condition is met by data from a population of L. parryae whose white morph has higher fitness (seed set) only in years of relatively heavy rain fall. The data suggest that the observed polymorphism may be explained by fluctuating selection. However, the yearly variation in flower color frequencies cannot be fully explained by our simple models, which ignore age structure and possible selection in the seed bank. We address two additional questions--one mathematical, the other biological--concerning the applicability of diffusion approximations to intense selection and the applicability of long-term predictions to datasets spanning decades for populations with long-lived seed banks.},

abstract = {The fuelling behaviour of long-distance migratory birds is expected to have evolved to minimize a number of potential costs associated with migratory behaviour. Optimality models have generated unique and testable predictions for some of these costs, including time, energy and predation risk. By remotely weighing free-living reed warblers, Acrocephalus scirpaceus, attracted to supplementary food, I found that the relation between their fuel deposition rate and departure load approximated to the predictions of a time-minimizing model. While the results indicated that time minimization has been an important selective force, fuel deposition rates appeared constrained at times, indicating that high rates of foraging or energy turnover have been selected against. I suggest that the need to minimize foraging intensity-dependent predation risk may be the reason for fuelling rates not being maximized. The limited variation found in the fuelling durations of reed warblers is consistent with the hypothesis that fixed fuelling durations are the behavioural mechanism by which time minimization is achieved, although there was also some evidence to the contrary. These durations are expected to have been optimized with respect to the range of fuelling conditions typically encountered and the journey ahead. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {1. Intraguild predation (IGP) is a commonly recognized mechanism influencing the commu- nity structure of predators, but the complex interactions are notoriously difficult to disentan- gle. The mesopredator suppression hypothesis predicts that a superpredator may either simultaneously repress two mesopredators, restrain the dominant one and thereby release the subdominant mesopredator, or elicit different responses by both mesopredators. 2. We show the outcome arising from such conditions in a three-level predator assemblage (Eurasian eagle owl Bubo bubo L., northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis L. and common buz- zard Buteo buteo L.) studied over 25 years. In the second half of the study period, the eagle owl re-colonized the study area, thereby providing a natural experiment of superpredator introduction. We combined this set-up with detailed GIS analysis of habitat use and a field experiment simulating intrusion by the superpredator into territories of the subdominant mesopredator, the buzzard. 3. Although population trends were positive for all three species in the assemblage, the pro- portion of failed breeding attempts increased significantly in both mesopredators after the superpredator re-colonized the area. 4. We predicted that superpredator-induced niche shifts in the dominant mesopredator may facilitate mesopredator coexistence in superpredator-free refugia. We found significant changes in nesting habitat choice in goshawk, but not in buzzard. Since competition for enemy-free refugia and the rapid increase in population density may have constrained niche shifts of the subdominant mesopredator, we further predicted behavioural changes in response to the superpredator. The field experiment indeed showed a significant increase in aggressive response of buzzards towards eagle owl territory intrusion over the course of 10 years, probably due to phenotypic plasticity in the response towards superpredation risk. 5. Overall, our results show that intraguild predation can be a powerful force of behavioural change, simultaneously influencing habitat use and aggressiveness in predator communities. These changes might help to buffer mesopredator populations against the negative effects of intraguild predation.},

abstract = {Regime shifts are massive, often irreversible, rearrangements of nonlinear ecological processes that occur when systems pass critical transition points. Ecological regime shifts sometimes have severe consequences for human well-being, including eutrophication in lakes, desertification, and species extinctions. Theoretical and laboratory evidence suggests that statistical anomalies may be detectable leading indicators of regime shifts in ecological time series, making it possible to foresee and potentially avert incipient regime shifts. Conditional heteroscedasticity is persistent variance characteristic of time series with clustered volatility. Here, we analyze conditional heteroscedasticity as a potential leading indicator of regime shifts in ecological time series. We evaluate conditional heteroscedasticity by using ecological models with and without four types of critical transition. On approaching transition points, all time series contain significant conditional heteroscedasticity. This signal is detected hundreds of time steps in advance of the regime shift. Time series without regime shifts do not have significant conditional heteroscedasticity. Because probability values are easily associated with tests for conditional heteroscedasticity, detection of false positives in time series without regime shifts is minimized. This property reduces the need for a reference system to compare with the perturbed system.},

abstract = {Eastern curlews Numenius madagascariensis spending the nonbreeding season in eastern Australia foraged on three intertidal decapods: soldier crab Mictyris longicarpus, sentinel crab Macrophthalmus crassipes and ghost-shrimp Trypaea australiensis. Due to their ecology, these crustaceans were spatially segregated (=distributed in 'patches') and the curlews intermittently consumed more than one prey type. It was predicted that if the curlews behaved as intake rate maximizers, the time spent foraging on a particular prey (patch) would reflect relative availabilities of the prey types and thus prey-specific intake rates would be equal. During the mid-nonbreeding period (November2013December), Mictyris and Macrophthalmus were primarily consumed and prey-specific intake rates were statistically indistinguishable (8.8 versus 10.1 kJmin22121). Prior to migration (February), Mictyris and Trypaea were hunted and the respective intake rates were significantly different (8.9 versus 2.3 kJmin22121). Time allocation to Trypaea-hunting was independent of the availability of Mictyris. Thus, consumption of Trypaea depressed the overall intake rate. Six hypotheses for consuming Trypaea before migration were examined. Five hypotheses: the possible error by the predator, prey specialization, observer overestimation of time spent hunting Trypaea, supplementary prey and the choice of higher quality prey due to a digestive bottleneck, were deemed unsatisfactory. The explanation for consumption of a low intake-rate but high quality prey (Trypaea) deemed plausible was diet optimisation by the curlews in response to the pre-migratory modulation (decrease in size/processing capacity) of their digestive system. With a seasonal decrease in the average intake rate, the estimated intake per low tide increased from 1233 to 1508 kJ between the mid-nonbreeding and pre-migratory periods by increasing the overall time spent on the sandflats and the proportion of time spent foraging.},

abstract = {Numerous animals move vast distances through media with stochastic dynamic properties. Avian migrants must cope with variable wind speeds and directions en route, which potentially jeopardize fine-tuned migration routes and itineraries. We show how unpredictable winds affect flight times and the use of an intermediate staging site by red knots (Calidris canutus canutus) migrating from west Africa to the central north Siberian breeding areas via the German Wadden Sea. A dynamic migration model incorporating wind conditions during flight shows that flight durations between Mauritania and the Wadden Sea vary between 2 and 8 days. The number of birds counted at the only known intermediate staging site on the French Atlantic coast was strongly positively correlated with simulated flight times. In addition, particularly light-weight birds occurred at this location. These independent results support the idea that stochastic wind conditions are the main driver of the use of this intermediate stopover site as an emergency staging area. Because of the ubiquity of stochastically varying media, we expect such emergency habitats to exist in many other migratory systems, both airborne and oceanic. Our model provides a tool to quantify the effect of winds and currents en route.},

Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between air and wind as a function of ground speed and air speed. This study shows that this approach can lead to erroneous results, due to spurious correlations. An alternative way to analyze air speed is proposed that overcomes the problems of one-dimensional linear models. The new model is non-linear and has two explanatory variables. Using two synthetic data sets with known properties and a data set with real observations of migratory bird tracks and wind observations, we illustrate the weaknesses of the conventional analysis as well as the strengths of the newly proposed model. This leads to the conclusion that for many studies a reanalysis of the effect of wind on air speed is desirable.},

abstract = {Population effects of competition between large carnivore species may be evident by contrasting actual distributions of putative competitors against predictions of inherent landscape quality for each species. Such comparison can be insightful if covariation with external factors known to influence the occurrence, density, or persistence of each species over space and time can be controlled. We used systematically-distributed DNA hair-trap stations to sample the occurrence of black bears Ursus americanus and grizzly bears U arctos across 5496 km(2) in southeastern British Columbia, Canada. We describe interspecific landscape partitioning according to terrain, vegetation and landcover variables at 2 spatial scales. We developed multivariate models to predict the potential distribution of each species. At sampling site-session combinations that detected either species, we then investigated whether the expected or actual occurrence of each influenced the likelihood of detecting the other while controlling for human influence and inherent landscape quality. Black bears were more likely than grizzly bears to occur in gentle, valley bottom terrain with lower proportions of open habitats. Each species also was detected less frequently with the other species than predicted by their respective models; however, the strength of this relationship decreased as landscapes became more characteristic of black bear habitat. As landscapes showed higher inherent potential to support grizzly bears, black bears occurred more than model prediction in areas with higher human access and proximity to major highways but less in national parks. As potential to support black bears increased, grizzly bears occurred more than model prediction only in national parks and less with increasing human access and proximity to major highways. Results suggest that competition is occurring between the species, and that the differential response of each species to human disturbance or excessive mortality may influence the outcome and hence landscape partitioning. Moreover, black bears are more likely to benefit from human encroachment into landscapes of high inherent value for grizzly bears than vice versa. Conservation implications relate to potential mediating effects of habitat and human influence on competitive interactions between the species.},

abstract = {Abstract The suggestion in the early 20th century that top predators were a necessary component of ecosystems because they hold herbivore populations in check and promote biodiversity was at first accepted and then largely rejected. With the advent of Evolutionary Ecology and a more full appreciation of direct and indirect effects of top predators, this role of top predators is again gaining acceptance. The previous views were predicated upon lethal effects of predators but largely overlooked their non-lethal effects. We suggest that conceptual advances coupled with an increased use of experiments have convincingly demonstrated that prey experience costs that transcend the obvious cost of death. Prey species use adaptive behaviours to avoid predators, and these behaviours are not cost-free. With predation risk, prey species greatly restrict their use of available habitats and consumption of available food resources. Effects of top predators consequently cascade down to the trophic levels below them. Top predators, the biggies, are thus both the targets of and the means for conservation at the landscape scale.},

abstract = {It is increasingly important to be able to monitor and maintain the quality of estuaries for overwintering shorebirds. Bird numbers alone are not sufficient to indicate quality nor, as recent research shows, can it be assumed that site quality is being maintained simply because there is enough food to meet the birds' physiological demands; i.e., the amount of food available per bird in autumn needs to be greater than the amount eaten. But how much greater? We used a simple individuals-based and behaviour-based model to explore the factors that affect the relationship between overwinter mortality and the amount of food available per bird in autumn (the food:bird ratio). The aims were to explore how the natural history characteristics of a shorebird species affected the shape of this relationship, in order to identify characteristics of the system that should be included in any monitoring programme of site quality. In all cases there was a minimum threshold food:bird ratio above which mortality did not vary and below which mortality increased steadily. The amount of food per bird required at the threshold varied from one to six times the amount actually consumed by each bird during winter, depending on the amount of realism included in the model. The minimum threshold ratio was most strongly influenced by the shape of the relationship between intake rate and prey density - the functional response - and, when interference competition occurred, by the distribution of the birds' main food supply. Simulations with realistic spatial distributions of prey predicted that the minimum required amount of food per bird would be between two and five times the amount actually consumed. The threshold approach could provide a simple method of monitoring estuary quality based on food supply and bird numbers. It also provides a potentially clearly-defined and unambiguous measure of the carrying capacity of a site. If applied to a sufficient number of real estuaries, general guidelines for maintaining estuary quality based on estuary characteristics, food supply and bird species might be established.

abstract = {The conservation of migratory species represents a major challenge, as they use multiple sites, all contributing in varying degrees in sustaining high survival and reproductive success. There is particular concern for shorebirds of the East Asian–Australasian Flyway (EAAF), where declining numbers of migratory species have mostly been attributed to habitat loss along the East Asian coast. Using a stochastic dynamic programming migration model, we assessed the effect of habitat degradation scenarios along the EAAF on migration behaviour, survival and reproductive success of a long-distance migrating shorebird, the Ruddy Turnstone (Arenaria interpres). Following manipulation of habitat quality through changes in intake rate, we found that changes on the wintering (major non-breeding) ground in South Australia had the highest negative effect on reproductive success and survival. We also identified Taiwan and the Yellow Sea as sites with high importance for reproductive success. Although habitats along the East Asian coastline are currently most threatened from a range of global change processes, we highlight the importance of conserving high-quality shorebird wintering habitat in Australia. This may be of notable importance to trans-equatorial migratory shorebirds, which often make a long non-stop flight from their wintering grounds in order to skip low-latitude sites that typically provide little food. },

Here, we show how a long-lived species that used to breed monogamously, and at low densities, can change its mating system in response to habitat saturation. We found that a significant proportion of unpaired birds become potential breeders by entering high-quality territories, or by forming polyandrous trios as a strategy to increase their individual performance. However, productivity of territories was reduced when those occupied by breeding pairs changed to trios, suggesting that the third individual was costly. The decision of some individuals to enter into breeding trios as subordinates also had clear negative consequences to population demography. This unusual mating behaviour is thus compromising the conservation effort directed to this endangered species; management to encourage floaters to settle in other suitable but unoccupied areas may be beneficial.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comparative genomics, or the study of the relationships of genome structure and function across different species, offers a powerful tool for studying evolution, annotating genomes, and understanding the causes of various genetic disorders. However, aligning multiple sequences of DNA, an essential intermediate step for most types of analyses, is a difficult computational task. In parallel, citizen science, an approach that takes advantage of the fact that the human brain is exquisitely tuned to solving specific types of problems, is becoming increasingly popular. There, instances of hard computational problems are dispatched to a crowd of non-expert human game players and solutions are sent back to a central server. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We introduce Phylo, a human-based computing framework applying "crowd sourcing" techniques to solve the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) problem. The key idea of Phylo is to convert the MSA problem into a casual game that can be played by ordinary web users with a minimal prior knowledge of the biological context. We applied this strategy to improve the alignment of the promoters of disease-related genes from up to 44 vertebrate species. Since the launch in November 2010, we received more than 350,000 solutions submitted from more than 12,000 registered users. Our results show that solutions submitted contributed to improving the accuracy of up to 70{\%} of the alignment blocks considered. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that, combined with classical algorithms, crowd computing techniques can be successfully used to help improving the accuracy of MSA. More importantly, we show that an NP-hard computational problem can be embedded in casual game that can be easily played by people without significant scientific training. This suggests that citizen science approaches can be used to exploit the billions of "human-brain peta-flops" of computation that are spent every day playing games. Phylo is available at: http://phylo.cs.mcgill.ca.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Many shorebirds exhibit within- and among-year site fidelity during their annual cycle. Little is known, however, about the migration ecology of Red Knots (Calidris canutus) that migrate along the Pacific Flyway and occur in Washington in numbers that exceed counts elsewhere on the flyway. At two large estuaries in coastal Washington, Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay, we searched for and recorded the locations of Red Knots (N= 547) that had been individually marked with leg flags at their wintering grounds in Baja California Sur, Mexico, during the period from October 2006 to April 2009. In 2010, we resighted 43 Red Knots at Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay that had been observed at these sites in previous years, primarily in 2009. We found a high degree of site fidelity between years, with birds observed in 2010 more likely to return to the same stopover site used in 2009 than to switch stopover sites. For knots that did not switch estuaries between years, the median nearest distance between locations where individuals were observed between years was 1.4 km at Grays Harbor and 0.6 km at Willapa Bay. Our results provide the first evidence of stopover site fidelity by Red Knots of the roselaari subspecies. Fidelity occurred at three spatial scales: coastal Washington, the two estuaries where we conducted our study, and specific mudflat areas within the estuaries. Because our study sites support high populations of bivalves, Red Knots may be returning to the same areas in subsequent years to exploit what we suspect is a predictable food resource. The abundance of Red Knots and high degree of site fidelity suggest that our study sites in Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay are important for the conservation of this species on the Pacific Flyway.

Investigaciones de fidelidad al sitio permitir{\'{a}}n contextualizar la importancia de los estuarios de Washington para esta subespecie en su migraci{\'{o}}n al norte. En las primaveras de 2009 y 2010 registramos, en Grays Harbor y Bah{\'{i}}a Willapa, playeros rojizos marcados individualmente con banderas en las patas (N= 547). Las aves se marcaron en Baja California Sur, M{\'{e}}xico, su principal zona de invernaci{\'{o}}n, entre octubre de 2006 y abril de 2009. En 2010 observamos 43 playeros rojizos previamente registrados, sobre todo en 2009. Encontramos una fidelidad interanual alta al sitio, con mayor probabilidad de reobservar a las aves en el mismo sitio en ambos a{\~{n}}os. Adem{\'{a}}s la distancia entre las localidades donde registramos a los individuos en los dos a{\~{n}}os, sugiere una fidelidad alta a zonas espec{\'{i}}ficas dentro de los sitios de escala.

As{\'{i}} la fidelidad ocurre a tres escalas espaciales: la costa de Washington, los dos estuarios y {\'{a}}reas espec{\'{i}}ficas dentro de los humedales.

abstract = {Long-distance migrants have evolved specific adaptations that make their athletic records possible. Unique mechanisms explaining their amazing capacity for endurance exercise have now been uncovered, particularly with respect to energy storage, mobilization, transport and utilization. Birds are champions of migration because flying offers a key compromise: it allows more rapid movement than swimming, but has a lower cost of transport than running. High efficiency for muscle contraction, pointed wings, low wingloading, travelling in V-formations, storing fuel as energy-dense lipids and atrophy of non-essential organs are some of their strategies to decrease the cost of transport. The ability to process lipids rapidly also emerges as a crucial component of the migrant phenotype. High lipid fluxes are made possible by lipoprotein shuttles and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) that accelerate lipid transport and by upgrading the metabolic machinery for lipolysis and lipid oxidation. Preparation for long flights can include natural doping on n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) from unique invertebrate diets. Muscle performance is improved by restructuring membrane phospholipids and by activating key genes of lipid metabolism through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). The physiological secret to long migrations does not depend on a single ;magic' adaptation but on the integration of multiple adjustments in morphology, biomechanics, behavior, nutrition and metabolism. Research on the physiology of migrants improves the fundamental knowledge of exercise biology, but it also has important implications for wildlife conservation, treating obesity and improving the performance of human athletes.},

abstract = {We coordinated censuses from April 1988 to April 1995 to obtain an overview of shorebird abundance and distribution in Pacific Coast wetlands of the contiguous United States. We attempted to acquire at least 3 years of data for all major wetlands from counts within a short time window each fall, winter, and spring. Fourteen abundant, 8 moderately abundant, and 21 rare-to-uncommon species were recorded. For temperate-zone breeders, peak periods of abundance were fall or winter and, when discernible for arctic breeders, mostly fall or spring. Arctic breeders were relatively more abundant than temperate-zone breeders in Oregon and Washington wetlands. All five of the most abundant temperate breeders were limited primarily to California wetlands in all seasons. Only for Western Sandpiper (Calidris mauri) and Dunlin (C. alpina) did the estimated total individuals present simultaneously in all wetlands exceed 100,000. Fifty-six of 66 sites surveyed had at least four counts and at least 100 shorebirds on one or more counts; 38 of the 56 sites held at least 1{\%} of 1 of 13 key species during at least one season. San Francisco Bay accounted for 24-96{\%} of the estimated totals for key species; Grays Harbor, Willapa Bay, Humboldt Bay, Tomales Bay, Point Reyes Esteros, Bolinas Lagoon, Elkhorn Slough, Morro Bay, Mugu Lagoon, Bolsa Chica, Mission Bay, and San Diego Bay held at least 1{\%} of at least half the key species in at least one season. The usefulness of five criteria for selecting key wetlands for shorebird conservation are examined and potential threats are discussed.},

abstract = {The nutritional quality of forage plants varies in space and time. This variation is presumed to drive the annual migration of herbivore species which follow peaks in the availability of high quality forage between sites. The green-wave hypothesis predicts that during spring migration to northern breeding sites, geese and other herbivorous waterfowl travel along a climatic gradient, taking advantage of the flush of spring growth of forage plants at each stopover site along the gradient. Here, we explore a basic assumption of the green wave hypothesis which states that there are successive waves of forage availability along the East-Atlantic Flyway from temperate to arctic sites, as spring advances. We use one of the migration routes of the Barnacle Goose Branta leucopsis as a model to compare data on food quality and quantity of forage plants with the timing of migration along its migratory corridor. We collected data on forage biomass and quality at three salt-marsh sites along the traditional migration route of the Barnacle Goose: a temperate staging site in the Wadden Sea, a Baltic stopover site and a Russian sub-arctic breeding site. In all areas forage biomass increased in spring, while the nutritional quality peaked early in the season and declined with increasing biomass. We combined data on forage biomass and nutritional quality in one measure, the nutrient biomass. For all sites, nutrient biomass showed a peak in early spring. We used observations on goose migration to examine whether the geese utilise these peaks in nutrient biomass, as is predicted by the green wave hypothesis. Our data show that the geese utilise the Wadden Sea staging site and the Baltic stopover site at the moments of peak nutrient biomass. At the Russian breeding site, geese arrive prior to the flush of spring growth of forage plants and profit from the peak in nutrient biomass when the goslings hatch and adult birds start moulting. We conclude that spring nutrient biomass is a key factor driving the timing of the annual northern migration of avian herbivores.},

Bar-tailed godwits did respond rapidly, both functionally and numerically, to a decrease in the density of M longicarpus, indicating that their intake rate was limited by food availability. The estimated seasonal depletion of the stocks of Mictyris by the godwits was 88 {\%} of the initial standing stock. Despite the virtual disappearance of Mictyris from sediment samples through the course of a non-breeding season, local densities of godwits did not change between October and March, implying that adequate rates of intake could be maintained throughout their residence period.},

abstract = {We determined the particle size composition of substrates, the species composition and abundances of mud-dwelling invertebrates, and the distribution, densities, and diets of Semipalmated Sandpipers foraging on different mud flats in Minas Basin, Bay of Fundy, during the birds' southward migration. Substrate types varied between the mud flats used by shorebirds; particle sizes ranged from sandy (coarse to fine sands) to muddy (mainly silt and clay). Of 34 species of invertebrates identified, the polychaetes Spiophanes bombyx (Clarapede) and Heteromastus jiliformis (Clarapede) and the amphipod Corophium volutator (Pallas) were the most numerous and widely distributed. Spiophanes and the "bamboo" worm Clymenella torquata (Leidy) were more abundant in coarse sandy substrates whereas numbers of Heteromastus were negatively correlated with grain size. The densities of Corophium were positively correlated with the amount of very fine sand in the substrate. The sandpipers foraged in larger numbers on mud flats where densities of Corophium were greatest and it was the main prey taken at those sites. The birds' diet was more diverse in areas of low Corophium density. It appears that the birds use visual cues for foraging and that prey behavior is particularly important in their choice of prey items.},

abstract = {Abstract: In spring and early summer, 1964, I visited 47 of 52 known nest-sites of Peregrine Falcons in the region from Colorado to central Alberta, mostly east of the Continental Divide. Of the 47, only 13 were occupied by pairs of Peregrines, including 6 in Colorado, 1 in Wyoming, and 6 in Alberta. I saw an unmated bird in Colorado and in Montana and two in Alberta. I did not visit three other recently used sites in Montana. Of the 8 unoccupied sites in Colorado, 5 were used as late as 1960, and in Alberta, 6 of 11 unoccupied sites were used as late as 1959. Five young are known to have fledged from the Colorado sites, and I saw 14 young in the six occupied Alberta sites. From 10 to 17 October 1964 I counted, marked, and banded Peregrines on the Texas Gulf coast. In this period I drove 1,052 miles and saw 52 Peregrines, or about one per 20 miles. Five immature females were resighted up to 6 days after release, showing that some Peregrines do not move quickly from the area. One went about 80 miles northward from the banding point. Since eight resightings were made, only 44 individuals were seen, and these included 20 immature females, 16 adult females, 6 females of undetermined age, and 2 immature males. It appeared that Peregrines moved to the sea-shore in the night because few were seen just before sunset and many were seen at dawn. Banding records indicate many Peregrines, presumed to be "arctic" birds, migrate to Central and South America to winter. Migrants reach the northern border of the United States in the first week of September and dwindle to only a few by the last week in October. Peregrines winter rarely in the United States, except in coastal areas. They are especially conspicuous on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, and most must be "arctic" birds since the eastern resident population has virtually disappeared. The reason for the reduction of nesting Peregrines in the Rocky Mountain region are largely unknown, but I think that direct human interference is a major deterrent.},

abstract = {The selection of flight speed (airspeed) in migrating birds depends on multiple internal and external factors, such as wing morphology, weight and winds. Adjustment with respect to side winds to maintain an intended track direction may include a shift in heading direction and/or an increase in airspeed. Compensation for cross-winds cannot always be achieved if visual references are lacking or may not even be beneficial if adaptive wind drift is favourable. Flock size is an additional, although often neglected, factor that could influence the airspeed of birds. Here, we show that responses to cross-winds to achieve compensation differed on a small geographical scale (a few kilometres) in migrating shorebirds, where the availability of topographical features such as coastlines may play an important role for the birds' behaviour. We also show that airspeed was significantly influenced by flock size in three species of shorebirds, increasing with increasing flock size. This is contrary to the prediction based on the hypothesis of energy saving by flight in flock formation, but in agreement with empirical findings for migrating terns. The reason why flock size influences airspeed remains unclear, but we propose a mechanistic explanation based on the largest/heaviest individual(s) determining the speed of the flock.},

abstract = {1. Animals breeding at northern latitudes experience drastic changes in daily light conditions during the breeding season with decreasing periods of darkness, whereas those living at lower latitudes are exposed to naturally dark nights throughout the year. Nowadays, many animals are also exposed to artificial night lighting (often referred to as light pollution). 2. Animals strongly rely on variation in light levels to time their daily and seasonal behaviour. Previous work on passerine birds showed that artificial night lighting leads to earlier onset of dawn song. However, these studies were carried out at intermediate latitudes with more limited seasonal changes in daylength, and we still lack an understanding of the impact of artificial night lighting in relation to variation in natural light conditions. 3. We investigated the influence of natural and artificial light conditions on the timing of dawn singing in five common songbird species in each of three regions in Europe that differed in natural variation in daylength (northern Finland, 65°N; southern Germany, 48°N; southern Spain, 37°N). In each region, we selected five peri-urban forest sites with and five without street lighting, and recorded dawn singing at the beginning of the local breeding season. 4. Our results show that the earliest natural singers, i.e., European robins (Erithacus rubecula) and common blackbirds (Turdus merula), started dawn singing earlier along with the natural increase in night brightness in Finland, with no additional effects of artificial night lighting. In contrast, the later singers, i.e., great tits (Parus major), blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), and chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs), showed similar onsets of dawn song relative to sunrise across the season and similar effects of artificial night lighting at all latitudes. 5. Artificial night lighting affected great tits, blue tits and chaffinches even in northern Finland where nights became very bright. Proximate factors such as differential light sensitivities may explain why early singers showed more plastic behavioural responses to naturally and artificially bright nights. The maintenance of rhythmicity in the late singers during bright northern nights and under artificial night lighting may also be an adaptive response to predation risk or costs of sleep loss.},

abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 29–35AbstractRobust critical systems are characterized by power laws which occur over a broad range of conditions. Their robust behaviour has been explained by local interactions. While such systems could be widespread in nature, their properties are not well understood. Here, we study three robust critical ecosystem models and a null model that lacks spatial interactions. In all these models, individuals aggregate in patches whose size distributions follow power laws which melt down under increasing external stress. We propose that this power-law decay associated with the connectivity of the system can be used to evaluate the level of stress exerted on the ecosystem. We identify several indicators along the transition to extinction. These indicators give us a relative measure of the distance to extinction, and have therefore potential application to conservation biology, especially for ecosystems with self-organization and critical transitions.},

abstract = {Worldwide, migratory species are undergoing rapid declines but understanding the factors driving these declines is hindered by missing information about migratory connectivity and the lack of data to quantify environmental processes across the annual cycle. Here, we combined range-wide information about migratory connectivity with global remote-sensing data to quantify the relative importance of breeding and non-breeding environmental processes to persistent long-term population declines of a migratory songbird, the wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina). Consistent with theoretical predictions about population limitation of migratory birds, our results suggest that habitat loss and climate have contributed to the observed declines in wood thrush breeding abundance, yet the relative importance of breeding versus non-breeding factors is population-specific. For example, high-abundance core breeding populations appear to be more limited by habitat loss, whereas low-abundance, peripheral populations appear to be limited by climate-driven seasonal interactions. Further, our analysis indicates that the relative impact of breeding habitat loss is at least three to six times greater than the impact of equivalent non-breeding habitat loss and therefore the steepest regional declines have likely been driven by the loss of breeding habitat. These results underscore the need for population-specific conservation strategies implemented throughout the annual cycle to reverse long-term declines.},

abstract = {Estimating the spatial position of birds in open habitats like intertidal mudflats is important for many studies, for example, detailed density estimates or linking predation pressure to resource availability. To date, several methods have been used to estimate the positions of birds, including density counts in predetermined plots, range finders, photography, and tracking individuals tagged with GPS-equipped transmitters, and each method has advantages and shortcomings. Counts in premarked plots are possible over relatively long distances, but small-scale information is lost due to within-plot averaging. Other methods accurately determine the position of individuals, but can only be used at relatively short distances or involve capturing birds. We describe a simple and low-cost method to estimate the spatial position of individual birds in open habitats using a telescope-mounted instrument that measures the scope's viewing angle. Using this Telescope-Mounted Angulator (TMA), the distance to focal birds can be calculated by simple trigonometry, requiring only the viewing angle and mounting height of the telescope. Laboratory tests revealed that the TMA was most accurate when calibrated for individual observers. Field experiments performed on a 4-m high observation platform showed that the TMA can estimate the position of shorebirds with an accuracy of 18 to 36 m up to a distance of 500 m. By also including the direction, determined with a compass, the spatial position of birds can be reliably estimated. The TMA can be a valuable tool for estimating the spatial position of animals in various flat landscapes, providing detailed measurements in a relatively short period of time.},

abstract = {Observations of the flight paths of pigeons navigating from familiar locations have shown that these birds are able to learn and subsequently follow habitual routes home. It has been suggested that navigation along these routes is based on the recognition of memorized visual landmarks. Previous research has identified the effect of landmarks on flight path structure, and thus the locations of potentially salient sites. Pigeons have also been observed to be particularly attracted to strong linear features in the landscape, such as roads and rivers. However, a more general understanding of the specific characteristics of the landscape that facilitate route learning has remained out of reach. In this study, we identify landscape complexity as a key predictor of the fidelity to the habitual route, and thus conclude that pigeons form route memories most strongly in regions where the landscape complexity is neither too great nor too low. Our results imply that pigeons process their visual environment on a characteristic spatial scale while navigating and can explain the different degrees of success in reproducing route learning in different geographical locations.},

abstract = {Evidence for climate-driven phenological changes is rapidly increasing at all trophic levels. Our current poor knowledge of the detailed control of bird migration from the level of genes and hormonal control to direct physiological and behavioral responses hampers our ability to understand and predict consequences of climatic change for migratory birds. In order to better understand migration phenology and adaptation in environmental changes, we here assess the scale at which weather affects timing of spring migration in passerine birds. We use three commonly used proxies of spring-time climatic conditions: (1) vegetation "greenness" (NDVI) in Europe, (2) local spring temperatures in northern Europe, and (3) the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO) as predictors of the phenology of avian migration as well as the strength of their effect on different subsets of populations and the dependence of correlations on species-specific migratory strategy. We analyze phenological patterns of the entire spring migration period in 12 Palaearctic passerine species, drawing on long-term data collected at three locations along a longitudinal gradient situated close to their northern European breeding area. Local temperature was the best single predictor of phenology with the highest explanatory power achieved in combination with NAO. Furthermore, early individuals are more affected by climatic variation compared to individuals on later passage, indicating that climatic change affects subsets of migratory populations differentially. Species wintering closer to the breeding areas were affected more than were those travelling longer distances and this pattern was strongest for the earliest subsets of the population. Overall, our results suggest that at least early subsets of the population are affected by local conditions and early birds use local conditions to fine-tune the date of their spring arrival while individuals arriving later are driven by other factors than local conditions e.g. endogenous control. Understanding what cues migratory organisms use to arrive at an optimum time is important for increasing our knowledge of fundamental issues like decision making in organisms during migration and is crucial for future protection of migratory organisms.},

abstract = {Long-distance migration has evolved in many organisms moving through different media and using various modes of locomotion and transport. Migration continues to evolve or become suppressed as shown by ongoing dynamic and rapid changes of migration patterns. This great evolutionary flexibility may seem surprising for such a complex attribute as migration. Even if migration in most cases has evolved basically as a strategy to maximise fitness in a seasonal environment, its occurrence and extent depend on a multitude of factors. We give a brief overview of different factors (e.g. physical, geographical, historical, ecological) likely to facilitate and/or constrain the evolution of long-distance migration and discuss how they are likely to affect migration. The basic driving forces for migration are ecological and biogeographic factors like seasonality, spatiotemporal distributions of resources, habitats, predation and competition. The benefit of increased resource availability will be balanced by costs associated with the migratory process in terms of time (incl. losses of prior occupancy advantages), energy and mortality (incl. increased exposure to parasites). Furthermore, migration requires genetic instructions (allowing substantial room for learning in some of the traits) about timing, duration and distance of migration as well as about behavioural and physiological adaptations (fuelling, organ flexibility, locomotion, use of environmental transport etc) and control of orientation and navigation. To what degree these costs and requirements put constraints on migration often depends on body size according to different scaling relationships. From this expose it is clear that research on migration warrants a multitude of techniques and approaches for a complete as possible understanding of a very complex evolutionary syndrome. In addition, we also present examples of migratory distances in a variety of taxons. In recent years new techniques, especially satellite radio telemetry, provide new information of unprecedented accuracy about journeys of individual animals, allowing re-evaluation of migration, locomotion and navigation theories.},

abstract = {Abstract Migration is a task that implies a route, a goal and a period of time. To achieve this task, it requires orientation abilities to find the goal and energy to cover the distance. Completing such a journey by flying through a moving airspace makes this relatively simple task rather complex. On the one hand birds have to avoid wind drift or have to compensate for displacements to reach the expected goal. On the other hand flight costs make up a large proportion of energy expenditure during migration and, consequently, have a decisive impact on the refuelling requirements and the time needed for migration. As wind speeds are of the same order of magnitude as birds air speeds, flight costs can easily be doubled or, conversely, halved by wind effects. Many studies have investigated how birds should or actually do react to winds aloft, how they avoid additional costs or how they profit from the winds for their journeys. This review brings together numerous theoretical and empirical studies investigating the flight behaviour of migratory birds in relation to the wind. The results of these studies corroborate that birds select for favourable wind conditions both at departure and aloft to save energy and that for some long-distance migrants a tail-wind is an indispensable support to cover large barriers. Compensation of lateral wind drift seems to vary between age classes, depending on their orientation capacities, and probably between species or populations, due to the variety of winds they face en route. In addition, it is discussed how birds might measure winds aloft, and how flight behaviour with respect to wind shall be tested with field data.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

The bias and variance of different methods and the comparability of repeated surveys versus once-annual censuses are poorly understood. Our objectives were to assess (1) the potential bias and variation of the more rapid incubating-adult counts compared to the time-intensive, and presumably more accurate, ground-nest counts, and (2) how accurately a once-annual census captured peak nesting abundance. We studied nine Least Tern colonies at Cape Lookout National Seashore (CALO), North Carolina, from April to August 2010-2012. We analyzed observer and survey method agreement with concordance correlation coefficients ((c)). We deployed time-lapse cameras at 156 nests and used repeated-measures logistic regression to determine if the proportion of time spent incubating varied with colony, time of day, or time of season. We found substantial agreement in abundance estimates of Least Tern nests and incubating adults between observers and survey methods, and among different times of day and seasons (all comparisons (c) {\textgreater} 0.97). Least Terns incubated eggs 94{\%} of the time on average during daylight hours, irrespective of colony, nesting stage, or month. Although the nesting peak at CALO occurred during the recommended census period for Least Terns, abundance estimates for surveys conducted at different times during that period varied by as much as 39{\%}. We recommend conducting incubating-adult counts to estimate nest and breeding population abundance of Least Terns or other waterbirds when vegetation or dunes do not obstruct views of nesting colonies. In addition, given the variation in abundance estimates for surveys conducted at different times during the recommended survey period, incubating-adult counts should be performed at least twice during the census period, with the maximum count reported as peak nest abundance.},

abstract = {Understanding habitat quality for birds is crucial for ecologists and managers, but few papers have explored the advantages and disadvantages of different ways to measure it. In this review I clarify terminology and distinguish habitat quality from related terms, differentiate habitat quality at the levels of individual birds and populations, and describe different field methods for measuring habitat quality. As much as feasible, biologists concerned with habitat quality should emphasize demographic variables while recognizing that reproduction, survival, and abundance may not all be positively correlated. The distribution of birds can also reveal habitat quality (e.g., through patterns of habitat selection), but researchers should first investigate how closely their subjects follow ideal distributions because numerous ecological factors can lead birds to select poor and avoid rich habitats. Measures of body condition can provide convenient measures of habitat quality, but to be useful they must be a consequence, rather than a cause, of habitat selection. Habitat ecologists should use caution before relying on shortcuts from more labor-intensive demographic work. To increase the reliability of our habitat quality measurements, we should work to develop new methods to assess critical assumptions of nondemographic indicators, such as whether birds follow ideal distributions under natural conditions and whether spatial variation in body condition manifests in differential fitness.},

abstract = {We describe a new collaborative network, the Motus Wildlife Tracking System (Motus; https://motus.org), which is an international network of researchers using coordinated automated radio-telemetry arrays to study movements of small flying organisms including birds, bats, and insects, at local, regional, and hemispheric scales. Radio-telemetry has been a cornerstone of tracking studies for over 50 years, and because of current limitations of geographic positioning systems (GPS) and satellite transmitters, has remained the primary means to track movements of small animals with high temporal and spatial precision. Automated receivers, along with recent miniaturization and digital coding of tags, have further improved the utility of radio-telemetry by allowing many individuals to be tracked continuously and simultaneously across broad landscapes. Motus is novel among automated arrays in that collaborators employ a single radio frequency across receiving stations over a broad geographic scale, allowing individuals to be detected at sites maintained by others. Motus also coordinates, disseminates, and archives detections and associated metadata in a central repository. Combined with the ability to track many individuals simultaneously, Motus has expanded the scope and spatial scale of research questions that can be addressed using radio-telemetry from local to regional and even hemispheric scales. Since its inception in 2012, more than 9000 individuals of over 87 species of birds, bats, and insects have been tracked, resulting in more than 250 million detections. This rich and comprehensive dataset includes detections of individuals during all phases of the annual cycle (breeding, migration, and nonbreeding), and at a variety of spatial scales, resulting in novel insights into the movement behavior of small flying animals. The value of the Motus network will grow as spatial coverage of stations and number of partners and collaborators increases. With continued expansion and support, Motus can provide a framework for global collaboration, and a coordinated approach to solving some of the most complex problems in movement biology and ecology.},

Northern Wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe leucorhoa), a 25-g songbird,
negotiates the North Atlantic Ocean twice yearly between Canadian natal
and sub-Saharan wintering grounds. Each autumn, these migrants appear to
have 2 options: (1) a detour via Greenland, Iceland, and/or Europe to
reduce the extent of open-ocean flights or (2) an astonishing nonstop
flight of 4,000-5,000 km without resting opportunities between eastern
Canada and northwestern Africa. We assessed the feasibility and
reliability of nonstop trans-Atlantic migration of Northern Wheatears
from Canada to Africa using an individual-based model incorporating
flight costs and autumnal wind data from 1979 to 2011. Prevalent wind
conditions were supportive of nonstop migration, especially at high
altitudes and when winds at departure were favorable. For modeled
individuals with high fuel loads, flying at altitudes of 3,000 m,
successful nonstop trans-Atlantic flights reached Africa on 62{\%} of
departure days. On 24{\%} of unsuccessful departure days, individuals
could have first stopped in Europe before continuing to Africa.
Durations of successful flights varied between 31 and 68 hr, with
significantly shorter flights after mid-September. It remains unclear
whether natural selection might favor nonstop ocean crossings by O. o.
leucorhoa between North America and Africa, but we conclude that
reliably supportive winds en route and potentially huge time savings
render it a feasible migration strategy.},

abstract = {Migratory birds rely on fueling prior to migratory flights. Fueling in migrants is controlled by intrinsic as well as extrinsic factors. From captive studies we have started understanding the internal mechanisms controlling bird migration. Field studies have demonstrated the effects of external factors, such as food availability, weather, competitors, parasites or diseases, on the stopover behavior of migrants. However, an integrated approach is still missing to study coherently how the innate migration program interacts with the varying environmental cues and to estimate the contribution of the innate migration program and the environment to realized migration. The northern wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe offers a unique opportunity for integrated studies. It breeds across almost the whole Holarctic with just a “gap” between eastern Canada and Alaska. All breeding populations overwinter in sub-Saharan Africa which makes the northern wheatear one of the most long-distant migratory songbirds with extraordinary long non-stop flights across oceans. It is a nocturnal migrant which travels without parental or social aid/guidance. Thus, young birds rely entirely on endogenous mechanisms of timing, route selection and fueling on their first outbound migration. By establishing indoor housing under controlled conditions the endogenous control mechanisms of northern wheatear migration could be revealed. At the same time, environmental factors controlling fueling could be investigated in the field. On migration wheatears occur in a variety of habitats with sparse vegetation where their stopover behavior could be quantitatively studied in the light of “optimal migration” theory by the use of remote balances, radio-tagging and even experimentally manipulated food availability. The present paper summarizes our approach to understand the control of migration in northern wheatears by combining field and laboratory studies at various spatial and temporal scales, and linking various sub-disciplines},

Increasing knowledge of the factors driving variations in shorebird numbers, phenotype and behaviour may allow shorebirds to serve as 'integrative sentinels' of global environmental change. On the basis of numbers, timing of migration, plumage status and body mass, shorebirds could indicate whether ecological and climate systems are generally intact and stable at hemispheric scales, or whether parts of these systems might be changing. To develop this concept, we briefly review the worldwide shorebird migration systems before examining how local weather and global climatic features affect several performance measures of long-distance migrants. What do variations in numbers, phenotype and behaviour tell us about the dependence of shorebirds on weather and climate? How does data on migrating shorebirds integrate global environmental information? Documenting the dependencies between the population processes of shorebirds and global environmental features may be an important step towards assessing the likely effects of projected climate change. In the meantime we can develop the use of aspects of shorebird life histories on large spatial and temporal scales to assay global environmental change.},

abstract = {Flexibility in scheduling varies throughout an organism's annual cycle, reflecting relative temporal constraints and fitness consequences among life-history stages. Time-selection can act at different scales, either by limiting the range of alternative strategies in the population, or by increasing the precision of individual performance. We tracked individual bar-tailed godwits Limosa lapponica baueri for two full years (including direct observation during non-breeding seasons in New Zealand and geolocator tracking of round-trip migrations to Alaska) to present a full annual-cycle view of molt, breeding, and migration schedules. At both population and individual scales, temporal variation was greater in post-breeding than pre-breeding stages, and greater in molts than in movements, but schedules did not tighten across successive stages of migration toward the breeding grounds. In general, individual godwits were quite consistent in timing of events throughout the year, and repeatability of pre-breeding movements was particularly high (r = 0.82-0.92). However, we demonstrate that r values misrepresent absolute consistency by confounding inter- and intra-individual variation; the biological significance of r values can only be understood when these are considered separately. By doing so, we show that some stages have considerable tolerance for alternative strategies within the population, whereas scheduling of northbound migratory movements was similar for all individuals. How time-selection simultaneously shapes both individual and population variation is central to understanding and predicting adaptive phenological responses to environmental change.},

abstract = {Two caging experiments were conducted on an intertidal mudflat to assess the impact of predation on two species of bivalves; Macoma balthica and Cerastoderma edule. The first caging experiment enclosed the shore crab, Carcinus maenas, carapace width 15-25 mm, in 1-m(2) cages. The three treatments were zero Carcinus (control), five Carcinus (the highest natural densities found at this site) and 20 Carcinus (a raised density). The experiment ran for approximately 1 month in August 1996. An exclosure experiment was conducted at the same site the following year and ran for approximately 2 months during September and October. The three treatments were full cages, partial cages and an un-caged control. Results from the enclosure indicate that crab predation was responsible for a reduction of both species of bivalve even at high naturally occurring crab densities. Significant reductions mere observed between all treatments for C. edule and between the control and 20 Carcinus treatment for M. balthica. Significant differences occurred in the exclosure experiment between all treatments for C. edule. Almost all of the C. edule were removed in the un-caged areas. Significant differences only occurred Between the full cages and un-caged areas for M. balthica. In both experiments there was a preference for C. edule over ill. balthica and for the larger size classes of both species. Previous work at the present study site showed Carcinus predation to be site-specific, with predation rates dependent on the sediment type. The density of Carcinus at this site is extremely variable; this together with sediment-specific consumption of bivalves may be one of the causal mechanisms for both the spatial and temporal variability shown in populations of M. balthica and C. edule at this site.

We asked whether site-level abundance patterns can be predicted by weather variables, and whether these effects vary over months and years. We used a spatially explicit hidden Markov model to estimate the effects of local and regional movement on population fluctuations.Although the species varied in their dynamics, with different amounts of movement estimated between sites, several patterns were common across species: density effects were highly month-specific, but with little variation in the strength of effects over years. The abundance of most species was positively related to temperature, especially in winter.The common teal Anas crecca and common pochard Aythya ferina were the most site-fidelic species once they were present in the study area, but also exhibited the strongest regional migration. The mallard Anas platyrhynchos, tufted duck Aythya fuligula and great crested grebe Podiceps cristatus each behaved more like a single population, as individuals more frequently moved between sites and abundance fluctuations at sites were not explained by migratory movements alone.Our study shows that the strength of population parameters and environmental forces can be decomposed into monthly and yearly effects. Estimating the unknown origin and movement of individuals may show that commensurate populations of mobile species may have different underlying dynamics, while responding similarly to environmental factors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.},

abstract = {Advancement of spring migration in response to recent global climate change is well documented for a variety of bird species, but the pattern for autumn migration is rather equivocal. During a 42-year period (1964–2005) the changes in timing of spring and autumn migration of eight wader species were studied at multiple inland sites in Central Europe (Czech Republic and Slovakia) using ringing data. While a clear pattern was found for the advancement of the spring passage, there were variable trends in the timing of the autumn passage. Three species significantly advanced (Wood Sandpiper, Common Sandpiper and Dunlin), three species delayed (Ruff, Snipe and Little Ringed Plover), and two species did not change the timing of the autumn passage (Little Stint and Green Sandpiper). Earlier studies had predicted that long-distance migrants wintering south of the Sahara would advance the timing of autumn migration, while short-distance migrants would postpone it. However, our findings do not fully conform to these predictions. Across species, the timing of both the spring and autumn passages was negatively associated with the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, suggesting that even in long-distance migrants the timing of migration might be under direct environmental control. In conclusion, phenological responses of birds to recent changes in climate are quite coherent for the early phenological phases; however, the responses to later phases are not so straightforward, and the present study contributes to this diverse pattern.},

While a wealth of research is devoted to the impacts of climate change on distribution range and phenology of migratory birds, the indirect effects of climate change on optimal migratory routes and flyways, through changes in air movements, are poorly understood. Here, we predict the influence of climate change on the migratory route of a long-distant migrant using an ensemble of correlative modelling approaches, and present and future atmospheric data obtained from a regional climate model. We show that changes in wind conditions by mid-century will result in a slight shift and reduction in the suitable areas for migration of the study species, the Oriental honey-buzzard, over a critical section of its autumn journey, followed by a complete loss of this section of the traditional route by late century. Our results highlight the need for investi-gating the consequences of climate change-induced disturbance in wind support for long-distance migratory birds, particularly species that depend on the wind to cross ecological barriers, and those that will be exposed to longer journeys due to future range shifts.},

abstract = {Many shorebird species undertake long-distance migrations punctuated by brief stays at food-rich, estuarine stopover locations. Understanding use of these food resources helps guide conservation and responsible development decisions. We determined the extent and degree to which Western Sandpiper (Calidris mauri) utilized biofilm as a food resource across a large and variable stopover location during northward (spring) migration. We investigated the spatial heterogeneity in diet composition, to determine whether shorebirds were consistently feeding on biofilm or whether diet varied between naturally and anthropogenically delineated sites. We used stable isotope analysis to estimate that biofilm conservatively comprised 22{\%} to 53{\%} of Western Sandpiper droppings across all sampling sites and that prey composition differed significantly between areas within the stopover location. Widespread biofilm consumption demonstrates the importance of biofilm as a dietary component. Variable diet composition suggests that habitat heterogeneity may be an important component of high quality stopover locations in the context of “state-dependant trade-offs” of Western Sandpiper population sub-groups. Future management decisions must consider and address potential impacts on the biofilm community throughout a stopover location, as single site studies of diet composition may not be adequate to develop effective management strategies for entire stopover sites.},

abstract = {The requirements of the orientation system of naı ¨ve long-distance night migrants were analysed by comparing data on Barred Warbler SylTia nisoria, Marsh Warbler Acrocephalus palustris and Spotted Flycatcher Muscicapa striata with data from a computer model of a clock-and-compass system. These species show, respectively, a rather restricted winter distribution in East Africa, migration through a very narrow corridor in East Africa, and rather widely distributed recoveries in the Mediterranean with more concentrated recoveries south of the Sahara. For all three species, to obtain the observed concentrations either a very high directional migratory concen- tration was needed in computer simulations to bring the birds successfully to their wintering areas or misorientating individuals would be subjected to a very high mortality. Neither the very high directional concentration nor the high mortality amongst misorientating individuals fit the empirical data sets. On the basis of the present study, the observed patterns seem difficult to explain by a simple clock-and- compass system only, and to account for the exceptionally precise migratory routes shown in this study it is proposed that first-time migrants might be able to use landscape topography on a regional scale in combination with corrections of direc- tional mistakes/wind displacements.},

abstract = {We studied: (1) concentrations and fatty acid compositions of plasma non-esterified fatty acids, neutral lipids, and phospholipids, and (2) fatty acid composition of flight muscle phospholipids in wintering, premigratory, and spring and fall migrating western sandpipers (Calidris mauri). Plasma neutral lipid and phospholipid levels were elevated in migrants, reflecting high rates of fat deposition. An important role of phospholipids in fattening is suggested by the fact that the amount of fatty acids in plasma phospholipids was similar to, or in spring as much as twice, that of neutral lipids. Changes in the ratio of plasma neutral lipids to phospholipids may indicate seasonal changes in triacylglycerol stores of invertebrate prey. Monounsaturation and total unsaturation of plasma neutral lipids and phospholipids increased during migration. Muscle phospholipids were more monounsaturated in spring and fall, but total unsaturation was reduced in fall. Arachidonic acid [20:4(n-6)] was especially abundant in muscle phospholipids In winter (29{\%}) and declined during migration (19-22{\%}), contributing to a decline in the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids. The abundance of plasma phospholipids and variability of neutral lipid to phospholipid ratio indicates that measurement of plasma phospholipids will improve methods for assessment of fattening rates of birds. The functional significance of changes in muscle phospholipids is unclear, but may relate to depletion of essential n-6 fatty acids during exercise.},

We proposed that positive correlations between shorebird and prey densities and between prey reduction and shorebird density might result in a negative feedback loop. The loop would be characterized by shorebird redistribution over time and equalization of shorebird and prey densities (and biomass) across the site. In support of the feedback loop (i) then were positive correlations between shorebird and prey densities (and biomass) early in migration; (ii) shorebird predation was responsible for declines of 49{\%} in prey density and 50{\%} in prey biomass in a shorebird exclosure experiment, with shorebird density positively correlated with prey decline in open plots; (iii) there was equalization of prey biomass across the site, and relative prey species abundance appeared to become more equal. Contrary to predictions, shorebirds did not redistribute after prey reduction, and patchiness of shorebird and prey densities persisted across the site. This failure was attributed to high prey density, even at the season's end, and high water depths. There were no confounding indirect trophic-level effects.},

abstract = {We investigated the importance of wind-assisted night for northward (spring) migration by Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) along the Pacific Coast of North America. Using current models of energy costs of flight and recent data on the phenology of migration, we estimated the energy (fat) requirements for migration in calm winds and with wind-assisted flight for different rates of fat deposition: (1) a variable rate, assuming that birds deposit the minimum amount of fat required to reach the next stopover site; (2) a constant maximum rate of 1.0 g/day; and (3) a lower constant rate of 0.4 g/day. We tested these models by comparing conservative estimates of predicted body mass along the migration route with empirical data on body mass of Western Sandpipers at different stopover sites and upon arrival at the breeding grounds. In calm conditions, birds would have to deposit unrealistically high amounts of fat (up to 330{\%} of observed values) to maintain body mass above absolute lean mass values. Fat-deposition rates of 1.0 g/day and 0.4 g/day, in calm conditions, resulted in a steady decline in body mass along the migration route with predicted body masses on arrival in Alaska of only 60{\%} (13.6 g) and 26{\%} (5.9 g) of average lean mass (22.7 g). Conversely, birds migrating with wind assistance would be able to complete migration with fat-deposition rates as low as 0.4 g/day, similar to values reported for this size bird from field studies. Our results extend the conclusion of the importance of winds for large, long-distance migrants to a small, short-distance migrant. We suggest that the migratory decisions of birds are more strongly influenced by the frequency and duration of winds aloft, i.e. by events during the flight phase, than by events during the stopover phase of migration, such as fat-deposition rate, that have been the focus of much recent migration theory.

@article{Iribarne2005,
abstract = {Here we address the question of whether the presence of the burrowing crabs Chasmagnathus granulatus affects small- and large-scale habitat use by migrant shorebirds. This crab is the dominant species in soft bare sediments and vegetated intertidal areas along the SW Atlantic estuaries (southern Brazil 28degrees S to the northern Argentinean Patagonia 42degrees S). They generate very extensive burrow beds in soft bottom intertidal areas. Our information shows that this burrowing crab affects the small-scale habitat use by shorebirds, given that shorebirds never walk through the funnel-shaped entrances of burrows. Given that crab burrow entrances occupy up to 40{\%} of the intertidal area, there is a large decrease of available shorebird habitat in crab beds, restricting their activity to the spaces between the burrows. The southern migratory shorebird Charadrius falklandicus maximize the use of these areas by foraging closer to the burrows than the other bird species. Neotropical migrants, such as Calidrus fuscicollis, Pluvialis squatarola and Tringa melanoleuca, used foraging paths that tended to maximize the distance from burrows, especially the distance to larger burrows. A field experiment showed that this was not necessarily due to a decrease in the availability of polychaetes near the crab burrows. A combination of landscape measurements and satellite images showed that crab beds covered up to 40{\%} of the intertidal area of the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (37degrees40' S, Argentina), and nearly 100{\%} of the intertidal area of the Bahia Blanca estuary (38degrees48' - 39degrees25' S, Argentina). These two estuaries are located along the migratory flyway of Neotropical migratory shorebirds, but the Bahia Blanca estuary (area similar to 110,000 ha) shows a much lower shorebird diversity than Mar Chiquita (area similar to 4500 ha). The most common species in Bahia Blanca is the two-banded plover C.falklandicus, the species least affected by crabs at Mar Chiquita and which prefers to use high-density crab areas as foraging sites. The oystercatcher Haematopus palliatus was also most abundant in high-density crab areas, but they used these areas for resting. The abundances of preys varied during the study period and between the crab density areas, indicating that the use of these areas by birds is independent of crab density. However, burrowing crabs affect the depth distribution of polychaete and thus their availability to shorebirds. We suggest that this shorebirds-burrowing organism interaction could be generalized for other intertidal estuarine habitats. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.},

In the present study, we investigated the effects of nutrient additions and shorebird exclusion on the infaunal assemblages of an intertidal mudflat. Where responses to nutrient additions were observed they only occurred in the high-dose treatments, indicating that a high nutrient loading is required before infaunal responses are initiated at this site. There was no evidence to support the idea that nutrient additions would only stimulate macroinfaunal assemblages where shorebird foraging was reduced. Instead, nutrient additions were detectable separately from any effects of shorebird predation and, contrary to expectations, appeared to be of more importance than shorebird predation in this environment. There was also no evidence to suggest that shorebird predation has a strong interaction with the infaunal prey assemblage and, although further studies will be needed to support this statement, it is possible that moderate changes in nutrient status will not impact on the shorebird populations at this site.},

abstract = {The annual life cycle of many birds includes breeding, moult and migration. All these processes are time and energy consuming and the extent of investment in any one may compromise the others. The output from breeding is of course the ultimate goal for all birds, while the investment in moult and migration should be selected so that lifetime fitness is maximized. In particular, long-distance migrants breeding at high latitudes face severe time pressures, which is a probable reason why natural selection has evolved efficient behaviours, physiological and morphological adaptations allowing the maximum possible migration speed. Optimal migration theory commonly assumes time minimization as an overall strategy, but the minimization of energy cost and predation risk may also be involved. Based on these assumptions, it is possible to derive adaptive behaviours such as when and at which fuel load a stopover site should be abandoned. I review some core components of optimal migration theory together with some key predictions. A review of accumulated empirical tests of the departure rule indicates that time minimization is an important component of the overall migration strategy, and hence gives support to the assumption about time-selected migration. I also briefly discuss how the optimal policy may be implemented by the bird by applying a set of simple rules. The time constraints on migrants increase with increasing body size. Some consequences of this are discussed.},

abstract = {Aim Avian migration strategies balance the costs and benefits of annual movements between breeding and wintering grounds. If similar constraints affect a large numbers of species, geographical concentrations of migration routes, or migration flyways, may result. Here we provide the first population-level empirical evaluation of the structure and seasonal dynamics of migration flyways for North American terrestrial birds and their association with atmospheric conditions. Location Contiguous USA. Methods We modelled weekly probability of occurrence for 93 migratory species using spatio-temporal exploratory models and eBird occurrence data for the combined period 2004 to 2011. We used hierarchical cluster analysis to identify species with shared migration routes based on normalized spatio-temporal representations of autumn migration. We summarized atmospheric conditions within flyways using nocturnal wind velocity and bearing estimated at three isobaric levels (725, 825 and 925 mbar) for the combined period 2008 to 2011. Results We identified three migration flyways: an eastern and western flyway whose paths shifted westwards in the spring, and a central flyway whose core boundaries overlapped with the eastern flyway and whose width was more constricted in the autumn. The seasonal shift of the eastern flyway created potentially longer migration journeys in the spring, but this longer route coincides with a low-level jet stream that may enhance migration speeds. Atmospheric conditions appeared to have a more limited role in the seasonal dynamics of the western flyway. Main conclusions Migration routes for terrestrial species in North America can be organized into three broadly defined migration flyways: a geographically distinct flyway located west of the 103rd meridian and two interrelated flyways located east of the 103rd meridian. Seasonal shifts in flyway locations reflect the influence of looped migration strategies that for the eastern flyway can be explained by the trade-off between minimizing total migration distance while maintaining an association with favourable atmospheric conditions.},

abstract = {To understand the mechanisms underlying the flow of social information in foraging groups, it is important to manipulate the behaviour of individuals and study the responses of flock members under different ecological and social conditions. Some studies have attempted this using three-dimensional models, like robots. Our goal was to assess the foraging and scanning behaviour of adult house finches, Carpodacus mexicanus, in response to robots mimicking different types of behaviours in artificial flocks (three linearly placed enclosures, with robots at the periphery and a live animal at the centre). We recorded whether live animals reacted to (1) the presence/absence of robots, (2) the motion of robots in relation to static robots, (3) variations in the type of robot behaviour and (4) the direction of the responses (increasing or decreasing their foraging effort). Adult house finches reacted differently to the presence, motion and behaviour of robots, and they spent more time foraging and less time scanning, which led to increasing seed intake, as the robots simulated body movement that could be associated with successful foraging behaviour (more handling time) or antipredator behaviour. Responses to robots were similar to those given to live conspecifics. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of using robots in social foraging research and conclude that robots are suitable to test some hypotheses on the foraging and antipredator behaviour of flocks. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {The Neotropics host breeding or non-breeding populations of 104 of the 109 species of New World raptors (i.e., members of the suborder Falconides and the subfamily Cathartinae), including 4 complete migrants, 36 partial migrants, 28 irregular or local migrants, and 36 presumed non-migrants. Standardized counts of visible migration initiated in the 1990s, together with a focused literature search provide an emerging picture of raptor migration in the region. Here I describe the movements of the principal species of migrants, and detail migration geography in the Neotropics. The Mesoamerican Land Corridor is by far the most concentrated migration flyway in the region. Three species of Nearctic breeders, the Mississippi Kite (Ictinia mississippiensis), the Broad-winged Hawk (Buteo platypterus), and the Swainson's Hawk (B. swainsoni), all of which are complete migrants, together with western North American populations of Turkey Vultures (Cathartes aura), numerically dominate this northern or “boreal” flight. Much smaller numbers of Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), Swallow-tailed Kites (Elanoides forficatus), Merlins (Falco columbarius), and Peregrine Falcons (F. peregrinus), routinely enter and leave the Neotropics via trans-Caribbean and trans-Gulf of Mexico routes. Southern or “austral” and intratropical movements, including dispersal and colonization in response to habitat change, are known but remain relatively little studied. Having detailed the patterns and processes of raptor migration in the region, I discuss what is known about the ecological consequences of these movements, including competitive interactions between migrant and resident species. I then go on to explore the role that long-distance migration has played in shaping raptor species distributions and abundances in the Neotropics. I conclude by proposing that the hourglass configuration of continental landmasses and the north-south orientation of mountain ranges in the New World, not only facilitate long-distance land-based raptor migration in the region, but also enhance regional raptor diversity via a speciation process called “migration dosing.” The process of migration dosing involves a series of events in which “doses” of diverted long-distance migrants (1) arrive in areas tangential to or beyond their major migration flyways, (2) remain there the following breeding season rather than returning to traditional breeding areas, and (3) eventually diverge from parental stock in geographic isolation. Likely examples of migration dosing are presented from two species-rich near-cosmopolitan genera, Accipiter and Buteo.},

abstract = {Migration is widespread among animals, but the factors that influence the decision to migrate are poorly understood. Within a single species, populations may be completely migratory, completely sedentary or partially migratory. We use a population model to derive conditions for migration and demonstrate how migratory survival, habitat quality and density dependence on both the breeding and non-breeding grounds influence conditions for migration and the proportion of migrants within a population. Density dependence during the season in which migratory and sedentary individuals use separate sites is necessary for partial migration. High levels of density dependence at the non-shared sites widen the range of survival values within which we predict partial migration, whereas increasing the strength of density dependence at the shared sites narrows the range of survival values within which we predict partial migration. Our results have important implications for predicting how contemporary populations with variable migration strategies may respond to changes in the quality or quantity of habitat.},

abstract = {Behaviorally mediated trophic cascades (BMTCs) occur when the fear of herbivores enhances Based pr?dation among plant productivity. primarily on systems involving small-bodied predators, BMTCs have been proposed as both strong and ubiquitous in natural ecosystems. Recently, however, synthetic work has suggested that the existence of BMTCs may be mediated by predator hunting mode, whereby passive (sit-and-wait) predators have much stronger effects than active (coursing) predators. One BMTC that has been proposed for a wide-ranging active predator system involves the reintroduction of wolves (Canis lupus) to Yellowstone National Park, USA, which is thought to be leading to a recovery of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) by causing elk (Cervus elaphus) to avoid foraging in risky areas. Although this BMTC has been generally accepted and highly popularized, it has never been adequately tested. We assessed whether wolves influence aspen by obtaining detailed demographic data on aspen stands using tree rings and by monitoring browsing levels in experimental elk exclosures arrayed across a gradient of pr?dation risk for three years. Our study demonstrates that the historical failure of aspen to regenerate varied widely among stands (last recruitment year ranged from 1892 to 1956), and our data do not indicate an abrupt cessation of recruitment. This pattern of recruitment failure appears more consistent with a gradual increase in elk numbers rather than a rapid behavioral shift in elk foraging following wolf extirpation. In addition, our estimates of relative survivorship of young browsable indicate aspen that aspen are not currently recovering in Yellowstone, even in the presence of a large wolf population. Finally, in an experimental test of the BMTC hypothesis we found that the impacts of elk browsing on aspen demography are not diminished in sites where elk are at higher risk of pr?dation by wolves. These findings suggest the need to further evaluate how trophic cascades are mediated by predator-prey life history and ecological context.},

Sedge Warblers migrated at a higher speed than Reed Warblers. The two species showed similar rates of fat deposition at our Swedish study site, although Sedge Warblers departed with lower fat loads. The higher speed of migration in Sedge Warblers and their lower departure fat loads suggest that they encounter stopover sites which offer higher relative fat deposition rates farther south. The amount of visible fat at the time of banding was positively related to the speed of migration. Estimates of speed of migration for the two species suggest that the recoveries were situated on average 76-111 km farther south per increase in fat score, corresponding to 58-85{\%} of the expected distance a bird can cover by using the fuel of one unit of fat score.},

abstract = {Western sandpiper (Calidris mauri) predation was examined by concurrent experiments and direct observations of foraging behaviour on high intertidal mudflats of the Fraser River estuary, British Columbia. Western sandpipers foraged by either "pecking" on the surface (64{\%} of observational time) or probing into sediment (29{\%}:). The first experiment (probe-mark method) consisted of collecting small-volume cores (21.3 cm(3)) of probed (experimental) and non-probed (control) sediment on the tidal flat, following a 22.5-min feeding period. The second experiment (exclosure method) involved deploying exclosures immediately prior to the feeding period and subsequent collection of cores from inside (control) and outside (experimental) the exclosures. Sediment cores were analysed for both macrofaunal and meiofaunal size fractions. Comparisons between macro- and meiofaunal invertebrate densities in experimental and control sediments revealed significant differences, attributed to shorebird predation? for both experiments. The probe-mark experiment detected the removal of large infaunal polychaetes (similar to 20 mm), while the exclosure experiment showed depletion of epifaunal harpacticoid copepods (0.063-0.5 mm). Predation on macrofaunal cumaceans was detected in both experiments. Invertebrates selected by western sandpipers neither fell within traditional infaunal size classifications (macro- vs. meiofauna; 500 mum delineation) nor corresponded to the highest densities of taxa. Rather, inference from experimental results and observations is that western sandpipers forage in two modes, by: (1) surface gleaning of epibenthic copepods and cumaceans in the macro- and meiofaunal size ranges and (2) selective probing for larger infauna, such as polychaetes. These findings were facilitated by the combination of methodologies employed.},

abstract = {Many organisms use day length as a cue for synchronizing their life cycles with seasonal changes in environmental productivity. Under rapid climate change, however, responses to day length may become maladaptive, and photo-responsive organisms may only be able to evade increasingly unsuitable habitats if they can accommodate to a wide range of photoperiodic conditions. A previous experiment showed that the pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, a Palaearctic-Afrotropical migratory bird, would strongly advance the timing of spring migration and reproductive maturation if it shifted its wintering area from sub-Saharan Africa to the Mediterranean region. However, it is unknown whether this marked response to latitudinal variation in photoperiodic conditions is continuous over the entire range of potential wintering areas, and if a shortening of migration distance would be an effective mechanism to adjust the timing of migration to rapidly changing climatic conditions. Here, we experimentally show that a moderate northward displacement of the pied flycatcher's current wintering grounds by 10 degrees would result in a clear advancement of the termination of prenuptial moult and the initiation of spring migratory activity and gonadal growth. However, we found no further advancement under conditions simulating higher wintering latitudes, suggesting the existence of a critical photoperiodic threshold or a steep gradual response within a narrow geographical range between 10 degrees and 20 degrees northern latitude. Because habitat conditions in this area are deteriorating rapidly, the potential for pied flycatchers to adjust their life cycle to changing climatic conditions by shortening the migration distance may be limited in the future.},

abstract = {Natural bioluminescence (that not mechanically stimulated by human intervention) produced by organisms on the seafloor of the northeast Atlantic ocean between 970 and 4,800 m depth was examined using an image intensifying (ISIT) camera mounted on an autonomous lander system. In the absence of bait little or no luminescence was observed but with bait present there was a significant inverse relationship with depth, Log10 (1 +  number of events h−1) = 1.7627–0.3235 depth (km) (r 2 = 0.8158, P {\textless} 0.001) indicating an average of 2.6 events h−1 at 4 km and 28 h−1 at 1 km. But in an area at ca. 1 km depth near carbonate and coral mounds the mean was 133 events h−1, much higher than predicted. In this bioluminescent hot spot 52–483 events h−1 were observed including moving luminescent targets and release of patches of luminescent material into the water around the bait so that on occasions the whole area around the bait was illuminated persisting on a time scale of minutes. At abyssal depths, luminescence was much less than reported at similar depths in the tropical NE Atlantic off Cape Verde. The sources of luminescence could not be determined but in the most active areas were associated with presence of eels Synaphobranchus kaupii which although themselves not luminescent may have stimulated luminescence from prey organisms such as ostracods (Vargula norvegica).},

abstract = {Many studies document that individuals visually scan for predators less frequently when in the safety of larger groups. This widely replicated effect has generally been explained in terms of distinct predator detection and risk-dilution effects. We show that a strict distinction between detection and dilution disappears when information about attacks is imperfectly shared (as it is in reality). Furthermore, dilution and detection effects change depending on when during an attack the predator targets a particular prey individual for pursuit. Realistic detection and dilution effects probably interact with each other and also with the targeting behaviour of predators. Instead of considering detection and dilution effects on vigilance, it may be more profitable to consider each prey's probability of being targeted during an attack and its probability of escaping if attacked. This perspective emphasizes that a full understanding of safety in numbers requires an understanding of predator targeting strategies.},

abstract = {The burrowing crab Chasmagnathus granulatus is an important bioturbator in SW Atlantic estuaries where they generate dense and extended intertidal beds. Its bioturbation leads to profound changes in the structure, quality and dynamics of sediments with concomitant impacts on the entire benthic community. In this study, we evaluate whether the presence of this crab affects the predator prey interaction between juvenile fishes and their benthic prey. Gut content and benthic prey selection by juvenile fishes inside and outside crab beds were evaluated, and predation effect was experimentally contrasted between areas using fish exclosures. The results show that in crab beds the percentage of fish with empty guts was lower and the number of polychaetes consumed by fish higher than outside crab beds. The silverside Odontesthes argentinensis and the catfish Pimelodella laticeps fed on larger polychaetes outside than inside crab bed areas, while the white mouth croaker Microogonias furnieri preyed upon larger polychaetes inside crab beds. In addition, field experiments shows that fish predation decreases polychaete abundances only in crab beds. These results suggest that crab bioturbation facilitate fish predation on benthic prey. {\&}COPY; 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Spatial variation in the abundance of nonbreeding shorebirds can be predicted to varying degrees by the density of their prey species; strongest relationships obtain from studies encompassing large spatial scales (e.g., entire estuaries). We examined variation in shorebird distribution and abundance within microhabitats of the Mad River estuary, California, with the following null hypotheses: (1) shorebird spatial distribution was random, and (2) no relationship existed between bird abundance and invertebrate densities. Shorebirds exhibited nonrandom spatial distributions; species were highly clumped within the study area. Most foraging calidridine sandpipers (Calidris minutilla, C mauri, and C bairdii) aggregated in sandy areas within 1 m of the tide edge, where they foraged by probing for a burrow-dwelling amphipod, Corophium spp. By contrast, Semipalmated Plovers (Charadrius semipalmatus) and especially Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) foraged by pecking in drier, coarse-grained substrates greater than 1 m from the tide edge. Corophium densities in sand exceeded those in cobble; Corophium densities explained significant variation (r2 = 0.36, 0.31 and 0.22) in the abundance of Least Sandpipers, Western Sandpipers and all shorebirds, respectively. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding variation in processes across spatial scales.},

@article{van_roomen_signals_2012,
abstract = {The Wadden Sea, shared by Denmark. Germany and the Netherlands, is one of the world's largest intertidal wetlands. Waterbirds are an important element of the Wadden Sea ecosystem. By their migratory behaviour they connect the Wadden Sea with other sites, ranging from the arctic to the western seaboards of Europe and Africa, forming the East-Atlantic Flyway. The Joint Monitoring of Migratory Birds (JMMB) project of the Trilateral Monitoring and Assessment Program (TMAP) follows the changes in population size within the Wadden Sea. In this paper we describe and analyse population trends over the years 1991-2009 for 22 waterbird species using the Wadden Sea in internationally important numbers and depending on intertidal mudflats. Population declines predominated in this 18-year period. More populations decreased in Schleswig-Holstein and Niedersachsen than in The Netherlands and Denmark. This is the case particularly for species feeding on polychaetes. In contrast, waterbirds feeding on bivalves are in decline in all regions except Denmark. On the finer spatial scale of tidal basins, these patterns in trends are still apparent, although much variation in trend directions exists within the Dutch Wadden Sea, especially in bivalve specialists. For those species for which we could compare the trend in the Wadden Sea with the trend of their entire flyway population, we found that the former were more negative. This finding and the contrasting trends between regions and tidal basins within the Wadden Sea suggest that causes of the population changes are to be sought within the Wadden Sea itself. These causes, which may act in combination, could be related to factors operating within the Wadden Sea only or with factors operating on a larger scale but having an intensified or differentiated effect within the Wadden Sea. Interestingly, the Wadden Sea regions where negative trends of benthivorous waterbirds predominate are characterized by a large tidal amplitude, whereas areas where bird numbers have generally increased are characterized by a small tidal amplitude. An inventory of possible causes indicated climate change, eutrophication, shellfish fisheries, invasive species and increasing numbers of avian predators as the most important candidates to be investigated further to explain the observed trends.

@article{Conklin2017a,
abstract = {Costs of migration, in terms of time, energy, and mortality risk, have a strong theoretical and empirical foundation in the study of birds. We expect these costs to be most severe for extreme long-distance migratory landbirds, whose demanding annual routines (e.g. non-stop flights ? 8000 km and return journeys ? 30 000 km) may approach their maximum physiological capabilities. To explore whether this is true, we review evidence in long-jump migratory shorebirds (Scolopacidae), focusing most on the prototypical example, the Alaska-breeding bar-tailed godwit Limosa lapponica baueri. Contrary to expectations, these and similar birds demonstrate high adult survival, little evidence for elevated mortality during migration, no apparent minimisation of non-stop flight distances, and low inter- and intra-individual variation in migration performance. Two key aspects of extreme migrants may explain these findings: 1) a counter- intuitively conservative annual-cycle strategy, which minimises risks and enables dissipation of carry-over effects before fitness consequences arise; and 2) selection pressure during early life, which quickly removes low-performing individuals from the population. We hypothesise that these two factors, applicable to extreme strategies in a wide range of taxa, act to truncate the range of individual quality in a population, and decrease the prevalence and detectability of carry-over effects. Testing these hypotheses is challenging, as it requires comparative studies of demography and individual quality spectra along a continuum of extremeness. However, it has important potential implications for interpreting individual variation, designing studies of cross-seasonal interactions or costs of migration, and recognising early-warning signs of population decline. For example, the most extreme shorebird migrations rely on abundant but difficult-to-access resources; the high minimum individual performance required for survival predicts that degradation of these resource hot-spots will propel rapid population collapse, rather than incremental declines in condition or performance. Therefore, in extreme migrants, we may paradoxically view populations as operating close to the edge, even while individuals are not.},

abstract = {Mass migrations are among the most striking examples of animal movement in the natural world. Such migrations are major drivers of ecosystem processes and strongly influence the survival and fecundity of individuals. For migratory animals, a formidable challenge is to find their way over long distances and through complex, dynamic environments. However, recent theoretical and empirical work suggests that by traveling in groups, individuals are able to overcome these challenges and increase their ability to navigate. Here we use models to explore the implications of collective navigation on migratory, and population, dynamics, for both breeding migrations (to-and-fro migrations between distinct, fixed, end-points) and feeding migrations (loop migrations that track favorable conditions). We show that while collective navigation does improve a population's ability to migrate accurately, it can lead to Allee effects, causing the sudden collapse of populations if numbers fall below a critical threshold. In some scenarios, hysteresis prevents the migration from recovering even after the cause of the collapse has been removed. In collectively navigating populations that are locally adapted to specific breeding sites, a slight increase in mortality can cause a collapse of genetic population structure, rather than population size, making it more difficult to detect and prevent. Despite the large interest in collective behavior and its ubiquity in many migratory species, there is a notable lack of studies considering the implications of social navigation on the ecological dynamics of migratory species. Here we highlight the potential for a previously overlooked Allee effect in socially migrating species that may be important for conservation and management of such species.},

abstract = {Selection and adaptation are two fundamental processes of biological change. Change, which emanates from internal, microscopic properties, eventually leads to alterations in macroscopic patterns. There is much interest in modeling selection and adaptation using reductionistic, genetic approaches. Here, we show that a macroscopic, system-level property satisfactorily models selection. For comparison, three different approaches are employed to model the selective changes observed in a population of Darwin's Finches. The first two models use a direct relationship between the changes of phenomenological characteristics in response to external perturbations (e.g., fluctuating weather conditions and resource availability). The third approach links adaptation to an ecosystem-level property, total system exergy, using a structurally dynamic model. Results show that although all three models capture basic system dynamics regarding the finch population, the third model most efficiently and accurately simulates system adaptation. This also illustrates that selective pressures may be tracked at the level greater than the individual. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We investigated the flexibility of body composition in relation to seasonally variable demands for endurance flight capacity and hyperphagia in a migratory shorebird. Migrating western sandpipers were sampled in spring and fall while refueling at a north temperate stopover and were compared with nonmigrating birds captured at a tropical wintering area in Panama. Sandpipers weighed 25{\%} more at stopover, and nearly 40{\%} of migratory mass increase consisted of lean body components. Most organs and flight muscles were 10{\%}-100{\%} larger during migration, and the greatest relative size increases occurred in the digestive system (including liver). Birds preparing to initiate spring migration from Panama deposited only fat, suggesting that changes in lean body components take place after migration has begun, possibly through training effects. Sex did not influence body composition. Juveniles making their first southward migration were similar to adults in structural size and body mass but had substantially enlarged alimentary tracts. Sandpipers appeared to deposit lean mass during stopover in fall but not in spring. The dramatic enlargement of the digestive system in this small species that makes short flights and fuels frequently contrasts with the reduction of digestive components in larger species that fuel only once or twice by making one or two very long flights to their destination.},

abstract = {The Numeniini is a tribe of 13 wader species (Scolopacidae, Charadriiformes) of which seven are Near Threatened or globally threatened, including two Critically Endangered. To help inform conservation management and policy responses, we present the results of an expert assessment of the threats that members of this taxonomic group face across migratory flyways. Most threats are increasing in intensity, particularly in non-breeding areas, where habitat loss resulting from residential and commercial development, aquaculture, mining, transport, disturbance, problematic invasive species, pollution and climate change were regarded as having the greatest detrimental impact. Fewer threats (mining, disturbance, problematic native species and climate change) were identified as widely affecting breeding areas. Numeniini populations face the greatest number of non-breeding threats in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, especially those associated with coastal reclamation; related threats were also identified across the Central and Atlantic Americas, and East Atlantic flyways. Threats on the breeding grounds were greatest in Central and Atlantic Americas, East Atlantic and West Asian flyways. Three priority actions were associated with monitoring and research: to monitor breeding population trends (which for species breeding in remote areas may best be achieved through surveys at key non-breeding sites), to deploy tracking technologies to identify migratory connectivity, and to monitor land-cover change across breeding and non-breeding areas. Two priority actions were focused on conservation and policy responses: to identify and effectively protect key non-breeding sites across all flyways (particularly in the East Asian- Australasian Flyway), and to implement successful conservation interventions at a sufficient scale across human-dominated landscapes for species' recovery to be achieved. If implemented urgently, these measures in combination have the potential to alter the current population declines of many Numeniini species and provide a template for the conservation of other groups of threatened species.},

abstract = {Darwinian fitness of an individual is measured by the number of recruits it contributes to the next generation. We studied variation in fitness among members of three cohorts of two species of Darwin's finches living on the Galipagos island of Daphne Major: the medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) and cactus finch (Geospiza scandens). Individuals of both species live for up to 16 years. Variation in fitness was neither random nor heritable. Non-randomness arises as a result of a few individuals living for an exceptionally long time and breeding many times. For each cohort, the number of recruits per breeder is strongly predicted by the number of fledglings per breeder. In turn, the number of fledglings is strongly predicted by longevity of the breeder. These results suggest that the most important determinant of fitness is the ability of an individual to survive to breed in many years. Morphological traits affect this ability. Although morphological traits are heritable they do not change unidirectionally because they are selected in opposite directions, and in different combinations, under fluctuating environmental conditions. Non-random fitness variation in fluctuating populations implies much smaller genetically effective sizes than breeding population sizes.},

abstract = {Migration during spring is usually faster than during autumn because of competition for breeding territories. In some cases, however, the costs and benefits associated with the environment can lead to slower spring migration, but examples are quite rare. We compared seasonal migration strategies of the endangered Baltic population of the dunlin (Calidris alpina schinzii) using light-level geolocator data from 26 individuals breeding in Finland. Autumn migration was faster, with individuals showing a “jump” and “skipping” migration strategy characterised by fewer stationary periods, shorter total stopping time and faster flight. Spring migration was slower, with individuals using a “skipping” strategy. The duration of migration was longer for early departing birds during spring but not during autumn suggesting that early spring migrants are prevented from arriving to the breeding areas or that fueling conditions are worse on the stopover sites for early arriving individuals. Dunlins showed high migratory connectivity. All individuals had one long staging at the Wadden Sea in the autumn after which half of the individuals flew 4500 km non-stop to Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania. The other half stopped briefly on the Atlantic coast on their way to Mauritania. One bird wintered on the coast of Portugal. Nine individuals that carried geolocators for two years were site faithful to their final non-breeding sites. Based on the strategies during the non-breeding period we identified, Baltic dunlin may be especially vulnerable to rapid environmental changes at the staging and non-breeding areas. Consequently, the preservation of the identified non-breeding areas is important for their conservation.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The coastline of the Gulf ofMexico in the United States is an important wintering and stopover region for migratory shorebirds.TheDeepwaterHorizon oil spill (April–August 2010) impacted more than 1700km of this coastline and could potentially affect shorebirds through long-term exposure to toxins, degraded habitats, and altered food chains. We investigated the exposure to Deepwater Horizon oil of seven species of shorebirds that winter or stopover along the northern Gulf of Mexico. From October 2010 to May 2012, we captured and banded 691 shorebirds at six sites that experienced varying levels of oil contamination. Of birds sampled, 22 were lightly oiled, with species that forage on the coast having higher rates of oiling than those that forage in more estuarine habitats. Although only 8.6{\%} of birds captured from October 2010 toMay 2011 and 0.6{\%} of the birds captured from August 2011 to June 2012 showed signs of oiling, an unknown, but potentially larger, number of shorebirds were likely exposed to indirect effects of the spill, such as decreased foraging time due to oiling of sites or disturbance from cleanup activities. Fuel stores and fattening rates of Dunlins (Calidris alpina) during spring migration, as measured using plasma metabolites, were not influenced by site oiling level. However, the level of disturbance at study sites was a significant predictor of both fuel stores and glycerol levels, suggesting that Dunlins stopping over during spring migration may have had difficulty reaching necessary fuel stores in spring 2011 due to disturbance from cleanup activity on oiled beaches. These effects from disturbance were only observed at sites with high cleanup activity, suggesting that the impact of oil-spill cleanup on shorebirds may be minimized by limiting cleanup activities to specific areas and times of day.},

abstract = {1. The impact of waders Charadrii on mud-dwelling invertebrates in central Europe was studied by comparing the rates of prey change over 13 days in 10 exclosures and control sites. 2. The most common invertebrates in the mud were chironomid larvae, which accounted for 90.5{\%} of all invertebrates. Chironomid larval density in the exclosures averaging 11075 individuals m-2, which is comparable to the high densities of Corophium volutator Pallas (9687 ind. m-2) found in a British estuary (Goss-Custard 1977a). 3. Ten species of waders, black-headed gulls Larus ridibundus L. and mallards Anas platyrhynchos L. either fed or roosted in the study sites during the experiment. However, the most numerous birds were black-tailed godwits Limosa limosa L. spotted redshanks Tringa erythropus Pallas and ruffs Philomachus pugnax L., which comprised 39.5{\%}, 33.6{\%}, 25.1{\%} of the total counted, respectively. 4. At the end of the experiment, the invertebrate density was significantly lower in the control sites (1594 ind. m-2) compared with exclosures (11938 ind. m-2) . Thus birds, particularly black-tailed godwits, spotted redshanks and ruffs, removed 86.6{\%} of the prey stock. Prey biomass was also significantly lower in the control (1.3 g m-2) than in the exclosures (9.5 g m-2). However, the mean length of the chironomid larvae was not significantly different between the control (7.87 mm) and exclosures (9.95 mm). 5. The impact of waders on the density of prey was also estimated from observations of the birds' feeding rates. The number of prey estimated to be taken daily by black-tailed godwit was 5765 prey m-2 for 13 days of the experiment while the estimates for spotted redshank and ruff were 1258 and 575 prey m-2 respectively. The total removed by black-tailed godwits, spotted redshanks and ruffs was therefore 7598 prey m-2. This compares with the 10344 ind. m-2 estimated to be removed by birds in the exclosure sites. The difference between the two methods is probably due to predation by other birds, such as other waders or ducks, and to the high variances of both estimates. 6. More small snails - Gyraulus sp. - were found in the control sites than in the exclosures, possibly because they were avoided by waders. 7. The total numbers of feeding birds, and the number of feeding black-tailed godwits, spotted redshanks and of ruffs declined during the experiment. The rate of food intake of black-tailed godwits, spotted redshanks and of ruffs also declined as the food stock was depleted. However, the number of roosting birds increased, although non-significantly, during the experiment.},

abstract = {Population models generally predict increased extinction risk (ER) with increased population variability (PV), yet some empirical tests have provided contradictory findings. We resolve this conflict by attributing negative measured relationships to a statistical artifact that arises because PV tends to be underestimated for populations with short persistence. Such populations do not go extinct quickly as a consequence of low intrinsic variability; instead, the measured variability is low because they go extinct so quickly. Consequently, any underlying positive relationship between PV and ER tends to be obscured. We conducted a series of analyses to evaluate this claim. Simulations showed that negative measured relationships are to be expected, despite an underlying positive relationship. Simulations also identified properties of data, minimizing this bias and thereby permitting meaningful analysis. Experimental data on laboratory populations of a bruchid beetle (Callosobruchus maculatus) supported the simulation results. Likewise, with an appropriate statistical approach (Cox regression on untransformed data), reanalysis of a controversial data set on British island bird populations revealed a significant positive association between PV and ER (p = 0.03). Finally, a similar analysis of time series for naturally regulated animal populations revealed a positive association between PV and quasiextinction risk (p {\textless} 0.01). Without exception, our simulation results, experimental findings, reanalysis of published data, and analysis of quasiextinction risk all contradict previous reports of negative or equivocal relationships. Valid analysis of meaningful data provides strong evidence that increased population variability leads to increased extinction risk},

abstract = {Predation and predation risk have recently been shown to have profound effects on bird migration, but we still know relatively little about how birds respond to predation risk en route and how this is translated into fundamental aspects of optimal migration. Here, we make the case that to understand the fitness consequences of foraging and anti-predation behaviour en route we cannot rely on single behaviour relationships but must take many aspects of behaviour into account, because of predation risk compensation. We show this in a case study of fat and vigilant birds feeding close to cover, which emphasises the importance and potential of predation risk compensation. Another reason for taking many aspects of behaviour into account is that different behaviours need not contribute equally to individual fitness. Birds faced with an increased predation risk during migration can compensate for increased predation risk in different ways. This implies that the adaptive value of a behavioural trait can still be ambiguous even if a survival cost can be correlated with particular behaviour where all other things are equal (e.g. in an experiment). That is because in natural systems there may frequently be many other ways for animals to compensate, because all other things are never equal, so that the particular behaviour can actually be of little consequence to individual fitness. In conclusion, when studying foraging decisions and anti-predation behaviour during stopover potential compensatory mechanisms should be incorporated. This knowledge is also critical for improving future models of optimal migration.},

abstract = {Stochastic simulation models requiring many input parameters are widely used to inform the management of ecological systems. The interpretation of complex models is aided by global sensitivity analysis, using simulations for distinct parameter sets sampled from multidimensional space. Ecologists typically analyze such output using an “emulator”; that is, a statistical model used to approximate the relationship between parameter inputs and simulation outputs and to derive sensitivity measures. However, it is typical for ad hoc decisions to be made regarding: (1) trading off the number of parameter samples against the number of simulation iterations run per sample, (2) determining whether parameter sampling is sufficient, and (3) selecting an appropriate emulator. To evaluate these choices, we coupled different sensitivity-analysis designs and emulators for a stochastic, 20-parameter model that simulated the re-introduction of a threatened species subject to predation and disease, and then validated the emulators against new output generated from the simulation model. Our results lead to the following sensitivity analysis-protocol for stochastic ecological models. (1) Run a single simulation iteration per parameter sample generated, even if the focal response is a probabilistic outcome, while sampling extensively across the parameter space. In contrast to designs that invested in many model iterations (tens to thousands) per parameter sample, this approach allowed emulators to capture the input-output relationship of the simulation model more accurately and also to produce sensitivity measures that were robust to variation inherent in the parameter-sampling stage. (2) Confirm that parameter sampling is sufficient, by emulating subsamples of the sensitivity-analysis output. As the subsample size is increased, the cross-validatory performance of the emulator and sensitivity measures derived from it should exhibit asymptotic behavior. This approach can also be used to compare candidate emulators and select an appropriate interaction depth. (3) If required, conduct further simulations for additional parameter samples, and then report sensitivity measures and illustrate key response curves using the selected emulator. This protocol will generate robust sensitivity measures and facilitate the interpretation of complex ecological models, while minimizing simulation effort.},

abstract = {Many birds and mammals respond to a heightened risk of predation, especially that associated with smaller group sizes, with an increase in vigilance. All interpretations of the way in which vigilance responds to changes in predation risk assume that animals feeding with their heads down (i.e. animals in a nonvigilant state) cannot detect approaching predators. We provide the first explicit test of this assumption by 'flying' a mounted hawk down a 15-m chute towards actively feeding, free-living, dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis. Juncos were targeted individually for simulated attack when they had either a 'head-down' view up the chute, or a completely unobstructed view; a junco with a head-down view could see up the chute only when it lowered its head to feed. Juncos with an unobstructed view almost always detected the hawk at the maximum distance of 15 m. Juncos with a head-down view usually detected the attack at a distance of 10-15 m against a grey background, but detection distances were shorter when attacks occurred against a camouflaged background. The results demonstrate that these birds have a considerable ability to detect approaching predators even when not overtly vigilant, although their detection ability is greater when they raise their heads. Vigilance sequences, therefore, probably consist of bouts of low-quality detection (active feeding) interspersed with bouts of higher-quality detection (overt vigilance) that can only be accomplished at the expense of feeding. This realization has major implications for current interpretations of the vigilance group size effect and antipredator vigilance in general.

abstract = {Counts of Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) at some migratory stopover sites have shown pronounced declines over the last 35 years. Counts from breeding grounds avoid sources of bias that have proven troublesome for trends estimated from migration surveys. Published and unpublished data were reviewed to examine trends in densities of Semipalmated Sandpipers at breeding sites across Alaska and arctic Canada. Information was sparse, and some comparisons are tenuous because methods varied over time. Valid time series were obtained for 13 sites across the species' range. In Alaska, Semipalmated Sandpipers either increased or were at least stable at six sites and decreased at one site. Surveys at both sites in the central portion of the range suggested no change in abundance. In the eastern portion of the range, trends were variable: decreases were observed at two sites, a possible increase at one site, and no change at another. Thus, the species was generally increasing or stable in the western and central portions of the range and had an uncertain status in the east. Also, trends in presence/absence data were analyzed from the Northwest Territories and Nunavut Checklist Survey. The species was observed at 345 sites, and results suggested that birds increased significantly in prevalence (assumed here to be correlated with abundance) across arctic Canada between 1987 and 2007. Overall, data from the breeding grounds do not support a range-wide decline in the abundance of Semipalmated Sandpipers, although data are insufficient for the long-billed population from the eastern Arctic for which specific conservation concerns exist.

abstract = {Information can enhance fitness, and the ways in which organisms acquire and use information are of heightened interest in ecological studies today. Migratory birds, as long-distance travelers of the globe, depend on rapid access to accurate information and thus provide particularly interesting study subjects for cognitive ecology. Yet, questions regarding how migratory birds collect information and make decisions en route remain to be answered. Here, we review the current status of this field of study and focus our attention on social learning (broadly defined as the use of inadvertently produced social information) as an important cognitive mechanism that can operate across taxonomic boundaries. We argue that social learning is critical to accelerate resource acquisition while reducing risks and uncertainties during migration. We put forward eight testable predictions in relation to when increased use of social information might be expected. Finally, we argue that migrant communities at stopover sites may serve as additional sources of information where transient associations with others may have important and long-lasting benefits.},

abstract = {Every year, millions of migratory shorebirds fly through the East Asian-Australasian Flyway between their arctic breeding grounds and Australasia. This flyway includes numerous coastal wetlands in Asia and the Pacific that are used as stopover sites where birds rest and feed. Loss of a few important stopover sites through sea-level rise (SLR) could cause sudden population declines. We formulated and solved mathematically the problem of how to identify the most important stopover sites to minimize losses of bird populations across flyways by conserving land that facilitates upshore shifts of tidal flats in response to SLR. To guide conservation investment that minimizes losses of migratory bird populations during migration, we developed a spatially explicit flyway model coupled with a maximum flow algorithm. Migratory routes of 10 shorebird taxa were modeled in a graph theoretic framework by representing clusters of important wetlands as nodes and the number of birds flying between 2 nodes as edges. We also evaluated several resource allocation algorithms that required only partial information on flyway connectivity (node strategy, based on the impacts of SLR at nodes; habitat strategy, based on habitat change at sites; population strategy, based on population change at sites; and random investment). The resource allocation algorithms based on flyway information performed on average 15{\%} better than simpler allocations based on patterns of habitat loss or local bird counts. The Yellow Sea region stood out as the most important priority for effective conservation of migratory shorebirds, but investment in this area alone will not ensure the persistence of species across the flyway. The spatial distribution of conservation investments differed enormously according to the severity of SLR and whether information about flyway connectivity was used to guide the prioritizations. With the rapid ongoing loss of coastal wetlands globally, our method provides insight into efficient conservation planning for migratory species.

abstract = {Mammalian carnivores are particularly vulnerable to extinction in fragmented landscapes, and their disappearance may lead to increased numbers of smaller carnivores that are principle predators of birds and other small vertebrates. Such 'mesopredator release' has been implicated in the decline and extinction of prey species. Because experimental manipulation of carnivores is logistically, financially and ethically problematic, however, few studies have evaluated how trophic cascades generated by the decline of dominant predators combine with other fragmentation effects to influence species diversity in terrestrial systems. Although the mesopredator release hypothesis has received only limited critical evaluation and remains controversial, it has become the basis for conservation programmes justifying the protection of carnivores. Here we describe a study that exploits spatial and temporal variation in the distribution and abundance of an apex predator, the coyote, in a landscape fragmented by development. It appears that the decline and disappearance of the coyote, in conjunction with the effects of habitat fragmentation, affect the distribution and abundance of smaller carnivores and the persistence of their avian prey.},

abstract = {Bird breeding and spring migration phenology have advanced in response to climate change, but the effects differ between sites. Here, we examine the geographical variation in laying- date trends in a short-distance migrant, the European starling Sturnus vulgaris, and a long-distance migrant, the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. We model the trend in laying date for these 2 spe- cies—between 1980 and 2004 for most of their European breeding areas—by combining geographi- cal variation in mean laying date, the effect of temperature on laying date, and spatial variation in tem- perature change. Starlings are predicted to have advanced breeding over most of their range, with the greatest advance in north-eastern Europe. In contrast, pied flycatchers have delayed their laying in northern Europe, but have advanced their laying in western and central Europe. The species differ because pied flycatchers lay their eggs 25 d later at each site than starlings, and temperatures during these 2 periods show different trends. Temperatures during migration have also changed differently for populations heading to different breeding areas. This was most pronounced for pied flycatchers; northern populations experience an increase in temperatures during migration, while more southern populations presently still migrate at temperatures similar to those experienced 25 yr ago. As a conse- quence the southern population may be constrained in adapting to climate change by low tempera- tures during migration. There is a large contrast in how circumstances during migration and at the breeding grounds have changed: populations that advanced breeding most were subjected to the low- est temperature increases during migration. The temporal and spatial variation in temperature change has important consequences on how migrants adapt to ongoing climate change.},

abstract = {Waders generally follow two alternative strategies. The "B-strategy" or "energy minimization" strategy is to initiate migration late in the season, start moulting at the breeding grounds and migrate slowly in small steps, whereas the "S-strategy" or "time minimization" is to migrate immediately after the end of the breeding period and moult on the wintering grounds after a migration with only a few stopover sites. We studied Wood Sandpipers Tringa glareola and Common Snipes Gallinago gallinago at the Polish Jeziorsko reservoir. Adult and juvenile Wood Sandpipers migrate during different periods, and showed no signs of moult. In contrast, both age groups of Common Snipe migrate during the same period, and up to 30{\%} of ringed adult Common Snipes had started their post-breeding moult at the reservoir. Wood Sandpipers stayed 4-5 days at the reservoir, where they fattened at a rate of 1.15 g/day (which was positively correlated with their length of stay, r = 0.21), and left with 21 {\%} of fat ({\%} of LBM), allowing them to cover distances exceeding 2,500 km (which enables them to reach the coast of the Mediterranean Sea). In contrast, Common Snipes stayed I I days, fattening 0.3 g/day, and left the reservoir independently of their fat reserve. Common Snipes stored a significantly smaller fat reserve than Wood Sandpipers, and their reserve was predicted to allow maximally 1,500 km of constant flight. Our findings support the hypothesis that, under common feeding conditions at Jeziorsko reservoir, Common Snipes behave according to the energy minimization strategy whereas Wood Sandpipers use a time minimization strategy},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Long-distant migrants timing their arrival on the breeding grounds face a tradeoff between optimal timing for breeding and optimal timing for survival. For many shorebird species, the flyway northward spans thousands of kilometers, and both conditions encountered en route and priorities of individuals can affect the timing of migration. We used data from spring migration surveys of Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) and Pacific Dunlins (Calidris alpina pacifica) along the Pacific Flyway of North America to determine whether the timing of their northward migration changed from 1985 to 2016. We compiled survey data for both species from 6 sites of varying size along the northern portion of the flyway from Washington, USA, through British Columbia, Canada, to Alaska, USA, and estimated interannual trends in the timing of passage through each site. Peak passage dates at the sites closest to the species' breeding grounds in Alaska became later by 1?2 days over the study period, while dates of peak passage at sites farther south became ?3 days earlier. A post hoc analysis suggested that local temperatures affected peak passage dates at most sites, with warmer temperatures related to earlier passage. Discerning patterns of movement by Dunlins at southern sites was complicated by the presence of winter residents. Simulation analyses of sandpiper movement through a stopover site highlighted both length of stay and timing of arrival as important factors shaping peak passage estimates. We suggest that Western Sandpipers appear to be arriving earlier at southern sites and staying longer at larger stopover sites, such as Alaska's Copper River delta. Our methodology generated specific predictions of peak passage dates on northward migration that may be useful in other systems for which historical count data are available.},

abstract = {In most long-distance migratory birds, juveniles migrate without their parents and so are likely to lack detailed knowledge of where to go. This suggests the potential for stochas- ticity to affect their choice of wintering area at a large scale ({\textgreater} 1000 km). Adults, in con- trast, may re-use non-breeding sites that promote their survival, so removing uncertainty from their subsequent migrations. I review the evidence for large-scale stochastic juvenile site selection followed by adult site fidelity, and then develop a ‘serial-residency' hypoth- esis based on these two traits as a framework to explain both the migratory connectivity and the population dynamics of migrant birds and how these are affected by environ- mental change. Juvenile stochasticity is apparent in the age-dependent effects of weather or experimental displacement on the outcome of migration and in the very wide varia- tion in the destinations of individuals originating from the same area. Adults have been shown to be very faithful to their wintering grounds and even to staging sites. The serial residency hypothesis predicts that migrants that show these two traits will rely on an individually unique but fixed series of temporally and spatially linked sites to complete their annual cycle. As a consequence, migratory connectivity will be apparent at a very small scale for individuals, but only at a large scale for a population, and juveniles are predicted to occur more often at less suitable sites than adults, so that survival will be lower for juveniles. Migratory connectivity will arise only through spatial and temporal autocorrelation with local environmental constraints, particularly on passage, and the dis- tribution and age structure of the population may reflect past environmental constraints. At least some juveniles will discover suitable habitat that they may re-use as adults, thus promoting overall population-level resilience to environmental change, and suggesting value in site-based conservation. However, because migratory connectivity only acts on a large scale, any population of migrants will contain individuals that encounter a change in suitability somewhere in their non-breeding range, so affecting average survival. Dif- ferences in population trends will therefore reflect variation in local breeding output added to average survival from wintering and staging areas. The latter is likely to be declining given increasing levels of environmental degradation throughout Africa. Large- scale migratory connectivity also has implications for the evolutionary ecology of migrants, generally because this is likely to lead to selection for generalist traits.},

How rates of decline are partitioned between common and less abundant species remains unclear. Using a 30-year data set of 144 bird species, we examined Europe-wide trends in avian abundance and biomass. Overall, avian abundance and biomass are both declining with most of this decline being attributed to more common species, while less abundant species showed an overall increase in both abundance and biomass. If overall avian declines are mainly due to reductions in a small number of common species, conservation efforts targeted at rarer species must be better matched with efforts to increase overall bird numbers, if ecological impacts of birds are to be maintained.},

Camera traps were placed at locations with and without tree logs (fine-scale risk factor) and at different distances from the core of a wolf territory and human settlements (large-scale risk factor). Red deer avoided coming close to large tree logs and increased their vigilance levels when they were present in close vicinity. The strength of these effects depended on the distance to the wolf core area; deer perceived tree logs as more risky when wolves were more often present. Hence, tree logs inside wolf core areas create fine-scale patches of fear with reduced deer browsing pressure, thereby enhancing chances for successful tree recruitment. Human presence shapes this landscape of fear as wolf core areas are located far from human settlements. This “human shadow” on predator–prey interactions is therefore an important component that should be taken into account in human-dominated landscapes.},

abstract = {Males of the horned beetle Onthophagus acuminatus Har. (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) exhibit horn length dimorphism due to a sigmoidal allometric relationship between horn length and body size: the steep slope of the allometry around the inflection of the sigmoid curve separates males into two groups; those larger than this inflection possess long horns, and those smaller than this inflection have short horns or lack horns. I examined the genetic basis of the allometric relationship between horn length and body size by selecting males that produced unusually long horns, and males that produced unusually short horns, for their respective body sizes. After seven generations of selection, lines selected for relatively long horns had significantly longer horn lengths for a given body size than lines selected for relatively short horns, indicating a heritable component to variation in the allometry. The sigmoidal shape of the allometry was not affected by this selection regime. Rather, selected lines differed in the position of the allometry along the body size axis. One consequence of lateral shifts in this allometric relationship was that the body size separating horned from hornless males (the point of inflection of the sigmoid curve) differed between selection lines: lines in which males were selected for relatively long horns began horn production at smaller body sizes than lines selected for relatively short horns. These results suggest that populations can evolve in response to selection on male horn length through modification of the growth relationship between horn length and body size.},

abstract = {A commercial mussel Mytilus edulis lay was established in 1998 in western inner Swansea Bay (Wales, UK) in a shallow, sublittoral, high tidal energy environment, on a substrate which previously supported a diverse inshore, sand/muddy sand benthic community. Within a year of commencement of this fishery, a significant change in the species composition of the benthic community occurred, with a decrease in the number of species and in the total number of individuals. The abundance of carnivorous and deposit feeding benthic species increased, whilst the mussels outcompeted other benthic filter feeding organisms, preventing the settlement of these organisms by ingestion of the larvae, and removed other benthic organisms by physical smothering.},

abstract = {Tracking repeat migratory journeys of individual animals is required to assess phenotypic plasticity of individual migration behaviour in space and time. We used light-level geolocators to track the long-distance journeys of migratory songbirds (wood thrush, Hylocichla mustelina), and, for the first time, repeat journeys of individuals. We compare between- and within-individual variation in migration to examine flexibility of timing and route in spring and autumn. Date of departure from wintering sites in Central America, along with sex and age factors, explained most of the variation (71{\%}) in arrival date at North American breeding sites. Spring migration showed high within-individual repeatability in timing, but not in route. In particular, spring departure dates of individuals were highly repeatable, with a mean difference between years of just 3 days. Autumn migration timing and routes were not repeatable. Our results provide novel evidence of low phenotypic plasticity in timing of spring migration, which may limit the ability of individuals to adjust migration schedules in response to climate change.},

abstract = {Autocorrelation is a universal feature of spatial ecological data and has been the subject of many highly cited review and methods papers in the ecological literature (Legendre and Fortin 1989, Legendre 1993, Koenig 1999, Diniz-Filho et al. 2003, Ives and Zhu 2006, Dormann et al. 2007, Beale et al. 2010). Variables of ecological interest frequently exhibit patterns of spatial similarity or relatedness. Measurements from geograph-ically close samples tend to have similar values or are at least influenced by one another. Related values compli-cate the assumption of independence in many statistical models, including linear regression (Legendre 1993). Ignoring the autocorrelation between related observa-tions can lead to incorrect inference (e.g., inaccurate P values, confidence intervals without the desired coverage probability, and rejection of the null hypothesis at rates differing from the nominal significance level). In partic-ular, when there is positive spatial autocorrelation in the errors of a linear model, there can be substantial inflation of Type I errors. Variables that have no effect on the outcome of interest may appear highly significant with artificially narrow confidence intervals. Therefore, ac-counting for spatial autocorrelation in widely used linear models is an important topic in the ecological literature. On the subject of this topic, a recent article by Helene Wagner (Wagner 2013; hereafter Wagner) proposed an original method of addressing autocorrelation in linear regression models. Termed spatial component regression (SCR), the method combines ordinary least squares (OLS) analysis with an ordination to identify and remove spatial patterns in the residuals. The ideas developed in SCR innovatively build upon earlier work using spatial weights as one way to model spatial autocorrelation either for use in inference or to reduce potential bias (Legendre 1993). We commend Wagner's exploration of the topic and synthesis of an impressive breadth of both novel and established methodology. However, in this response we demonstrate that SCR as proposed by Wagner does not provide a solution to the inferential challenges presented by spatial autocorrelation. Through simulation, we describe several examples where SCR will actually worsen the problem. The primary concern with autocorrelation in a statistical modeling context is its effect on inference. Therefore the goal of a method designed to address autocorrelation should be to improve the performance of inferential procedures. In general, SCR uniformly fails to control the Type I error rate in situations where it is inflated by spatial autocorre-lation. Complicating the method further, the results of SCR are highly dependent upon the choice of a spatial weights matrix describing the geographic similarity between observations. Model selection for any given problem is tricky and should be based on the system being examined and potential explanatory variables. Model selection procedures should be prespecified to the extent possible to preserve inferential reliability. However, the selection process for the SCR spatial weights matrix for any given problem is ambiguous. This is a serious concern because different matrices can lead to dramatically different results, and there is potential for significant selection bias in the choice of spatial weights matrix. Wagner presented a numeric example using a single small simulated data set and an analysis of a well-known data set, but did not attempt to assess the performance of SCR through extensive simulation. Multiple experi-ments consisting of a variety of simulated data sets are needed to assess the impact SCR has upon inference. We add our comment to broadly test the SCR methodology. This comment is a summary of the results of a range of simulation experiments designed to assess the following objectives: (Q1) Inference under the null hypothesis. When a predictor of interest has no effect on the outcome, how frequently will we achieve a significant result at the nominal level a? If inference using a given method (OLS or SCR, for example) is correct, we should reject the null hypothesis at rate a. However, spatial autocorrelation can erroneously increase the apparent significance of spatial predictors and lead to an excess of Type I errors. (Q2) Inference when the predictor of interest does have an effect on the outcome. Do confidence intervals for the coefficient of a predictor of interest contain the true value at the desired rate of (1 {\`{A}} a)?},

abstract = {Animals balance feeding and anti-predator behaviors at various temporal scales. When risk is infrequent or brief, prey can postpone feeding in the short term and temporally allocate feeding behavior to less risky periods. If risk is frequent or lengthy, however, prey must eventually resume feeding to avoid fitness consequences. Species may exhibit different behavioral strategies, depending on the fitness tradeoffs that exist in their environment or across their life histories. North Pacific flatfishes that share juvenile rearing habitat exhibit a variety of responses to predation risk, but their response to risk frequency has not been examined. We observed the feeding and anti-predator behaviors of young-of-the-year English sole ( Parophrys vetulus ), northern rock sole ( Lepidopsetta polyxystra ), and Pacific halibut ( Hippoglossus stenolepis )—three species that exhibit divergent anti-predator strategies—following exposure to three levels of predation risk: no risk, infrequent (two exposures/day), and frequent (five exposures/day). The English sole responded to the frequent risk treatment with higher feeding rates than during infrequent risk, following a pattern of behavioral response that is predicted by the risk allocation hypothesis; rock sole and halibut did not follow the predicted pattern, but this may be due to the limited range of treatments. Our observations of unique anti-predator strategies, along with differences in foraging and species-specific ecologies, suggest divergent trajectories of risk allocation for the three species.},

abstract = {Birds migrating between widely separated wintering and breeding grounds may choose among a number of potential stopover sites by using different itineraries. Our aim is to predict the optimal migration schedule in terms of (1) rates of fuel deposition, (2) departure fuel loads and (3) stopover site use, when only a handful of such sites are available. We assume that reproductive success depends on the date and fuel load at arrival on the breeding grounds. On migration, the birds face a trade-off between gaining fuel and avoiding predation. To allow the optimal decision at any given moment to depend on the fuel load and the location of the bird, as well as on unpredictability in conditions, we employed stochastic dynamic programming. This technique assumes that the birds know the probability distribution of conditions in all sites, but not the particular realization they will encounter. We examined the consequences of varying aspects of the model, like (1) the shape of the relationship between arrival date and fitness, (2) the presence of stochasticity in fuel deposition rates and wind conditions, and (3) the nature of predation (i.e. whether predation risk depends on the fuel load of the birds or their feeding intensity). Optimal fuel deposition rates are predicted to be constant if there are either only predation risks of maintaining stores or only risks of acquiring fuel stores. If only fuel acquisition is risky, fuel deposition rates can be below maximum, especially if there also is an intermediate best arrival time at the breeding ground. The fuel deposition rate at a site then depends not just on the site's quality but on the qualities of all visited sites. In contrast, rates of fuel deposition are not constant if both the acquisition and the maintenance of fuel stores carry risk. Optimal departure fuel loads are just enough to reach the next site if the environment is deterministic and are simply set by the energetic cost of covering the distance. As with time-minimizing models, more fuel than necessary to reach a site is only deposited under very restricted circumstances. Such overloads are more likely to be deposited if either fuel gains or expenditure are stochastic. The size of overloads is then determined by the variance in fuel gain at the target site and the worst possible conditions during flight. Site use is modified by differences in predation risk between sites and differences in fuel deposition rates. An expression derived to predict site use under time minimization provides a good approximation in state-dependent models. In some cases, the possibility of starvation may influence optimal decisions, even when the probability of starvation under the optimal policy is low. This effect of starvation has also been found in other contexts.},

abstract = {Long-distance migration, and the study of the migrants who undertake these journeys, has fascinated generations of biologists. However, many aspects of the annual cycles of these migrants remain a mystery as do many of the driving forces behind the evolution and maintenance of the migrations themselves. In this article we discuss nutritional, energetic, temporal and disease-risk bottlenecks in the annual cycle of long-distance migrants, taking a sandpiper, the red knot Calidris canutus, as a focal species. Red knots have six recognized subspecies each with different migratory routes, well-known patterns of connectivity and contrasting annual cycles. The diversity of red knot annual cycles allows us to discuss the existence and the effects of bottlenecks in a comparative framework. We examine the evidence for bottlenecks focusing on the quality of breeding plumage and the timing of moult as indicators in the six subspecies. In terms of breeding plumage coloration, quality and timing of prealternate body moult (from non-breeding into breeding plumage), the longest migrating knot subspecies, Calidris canutus rogersi and Calidris canutus rufa, show the greatest impact of bottlenecking. The same is true in terms of prebasic body moult (from breeding into non-breeding plumage) which in case of both C. c. rogersi and C. c. rufa overlaps with southward migration and may even commence in the breeding grounds. To close our discussion of bottlenecks in long-distance migrants, we make predictions about how migrants might be impacted via physiological 'trade-offs' throughout the annual cycle, using investment in immune function as an example. We also predict how bottlenecks may affect the distribution of mortality throughout the annual cycle. We hope that this framework will be applicable to other species and types of migrants, thus expanding the comparative database for the future evaluation of seasonal selection pressures and the evolution of annual cycles in long-distance migrants. Furthermore, we hope that this synthesis of recent advancements in the knowledge of red knot annual cycles will prove useful in the ongoing attempts to model annual cycles in migratory birds.},

Determining the status of these data-deficient (DD) species is essential to developing an accurate picture of global biodiversity and identifying potentially threatened DD species. To address this knowledge gap, we used predictive models incorporating species' life history, geography, and threat information to predict the conservation status of DD terrestrial mammals. We constructed the models with 7 machine learning (ML) tools trained on species of known status. The resultant models showed very high species classification accuracy (up to 92{\%}) and ability to correctly identify centers of threatened species richness. Applying the best model to DD species, we predicted 313 of 493 DD species (64{\%}) to be at risk of extinction, which increases the estimated proportion of threatened terrestrial mammals from 22{\%} to 27{\%}. Regions predicted to contain large numbers of threatened DD species are already conservation priorities, but species in these areas show considerably higher levels of risk than previously recognized. We conclude that unless directly targeted for monitoring, species classified as DD are likely to go extinct without notice. Taking into account information on DD species may therefore help alleviate data gaps in biodiversity indicators and conserve poorly known biodiversity.

abstract = {The decline of many species of Neotropical migrants has prompted increased research on their ecology on their breeding and wintering grounds. However, studies of their ecology during migration are relatively few. Despite documentation of molt-migration in at least six Neotropical passerine species, this phenomenon has been ignored in current conservation strategies for Neotropical migrants. In this review paper, we suggest that molt studies need to be done as a way to refine and improve conservation plans for Neotropical migrants. We identify three important questions that merit further study: (1) which Neotropical migrant species undergo flight feather molt at migratory-stopover sites; (2) where are molt-migration stopover sites geographically located; and (3) why are these sites preferred as stopover sites during molt? Finding answers to these questions will allow us to protect molt staging areas occupied by Neotropical migrants during migration as many wetland and nearshore oceanic habitats have been protected for molting waterfowl, shorebirds, and seabirds. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Long-distance migratory passerine birds are generally time constrained by reproduction and moult, which need to be completed before migration. Breeding and post-nuptial moult may overlap especially under time-constrained conditions (northern latitudes). Here, we analysed the timing of adult moult in relation to latitude, timing of breeding and reproductive effort in pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) breeding in four widely separated populations (40-68 degrees N). In males but not females, the proportion of moulting birds while provisioning nestlings increased with increasing latitude. This may suggest that a moult-breeding overlap is a strategy employed by male pied flycatchers to adjust to the short breeding season at northern latitudes. However, the moult-breeding overlap was more pronounced among males in the southernmost study population (Spain). In this population, males may decide not to invest more in reproduction, and start moulting at earlier breeding stage than in northern populations,or, alternatively, birds in the Mediterranean region are time constrained by the hot and dry summer. The trade-off between breeding and postnuptial moult may be more important in some populations than in others, depending on the latitude of the breeding site. Our results show that a moult-breeding overlap imposes a fitness cost on males in terms of fecundity and breeding success},

abstract = {Animals gain antipredation benefits from being in larger groups through increased probability of predator detection, dilution of individual risk of being attacked and confusion of predators during attack. A further benefit is that individuals in larger groups can decrease the amount of time they spend being vigilant, while maintaining a high probability of predator detection. They may then gain extra time to forage, so increasing overall intake rate. Increasing group size, however, can also increase competition so that intake rates decrease. We investigated whether there was a foraging benefit in redshanks, Tringa totanus, that show the group size decrease in individual vigilance. Intake rates did not change with group size, despite an increase in time spent foraging. Interference competition increased with group size because individuals travelled more to find prey. Redshanks used the extra time available to forage to maintain intake rates under increased competition. Although the group size effect on vigilance did not accrue direct foraging benefits, larger groups formed, conferring other antipredation benefits. Intake rates were maintained because the interference competition was compensated by the benefits of reduced individual vigilance. ?? 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Adult birds replace their flight feathers (moult) at least once per year, either in summer after termination of breeding or (in the case of some long-distance migratory species) in the winter quarters. We reconstructed the evolutionary pathways leading to summer and winter moult using recently published molecular phylogenetic information on the relationships of the Western Palearctic warblers (Aves: Sylviidae). Our phylogenetic analysis indicates that summer moult is the ancestral pattern and that winter moult has evolved 7–10 times in this clade. As taxa increased their migratory distance and colonized northern breeding areas, summer moult disappeared and winter moult evolved. Our data also allows us to trace the historical origins of unusual moult patterns such as the split-moult and biannual moult strategies: the most parsimonous explanations for their origins is that they evolved from ancestral states of summer moult. We briefly discuss our results in the light of recent criticisms against phylogenetic comparative methods and the utility of historical versus functional definitions of adapation.},

abstract = {We studied phenology, staging time and refuelling in Broad-billed Sandpipers Limicola falcinellus stopping over during spring migration in the Sivash (Black Sea, Ukraine) in May 1991-94. In the study area, peak staging numbers of 2000-2500 individuals occurred in the third week of May. In May 1993, 460 birds were marked with a yellow dye and 126 of these were colour-ringed. Before 28 May no departure of birds dyed yellow could be detected; by 3 June all birds had departed. Colour-ringed adults in mid May 1993 staged for a minimum of 8.2 days. After the observed departure of large flocks (24 May and later) the staging time of colour-ringed birds decreased significantly with body mass at the time of capture. Of birds mist-netted in 1991-94, 99.3{\%} were in full summer plumage and 89{\%} were adults. In second-year birds, fuel deposition rate (measured between individuals) was 0.44 g/day. In adults caught from early May to 24 May, overall fuel deposition rate was 1.04 g/day (3.4{\%} of lean body mass). Mean adult body mass in early May was 34.8 g, increasing to 45.5 g after 24 May. Estimated body mass at departure was 51 g. Departure body mass and flight range estimates suggest that although birds refuelled quickly, fuel loads are only just sufficient for an unbroken flight to Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula. We suggest that Broad-billed Sandpipers use the Sivash as a crucial final take-off stopover site, and that they follow a 'jumping' migration strategy, performed under narrow time constraints.},

Here, we studied spatial and temporal variation in populations of Corophium volutator, an intertidal amphipod that is the most abundant macro-invertebrate on mudflats in the upper Bay of Fundy, Canada. Variables that were quantified included density (peaked in mid-summer at 10,000s per m(2)), proportion juvenile (an index of population structure), sex ratio (female-biased throughout the year), proportion of females that were ovigerous (reproduction occurs between May and August). and fecundity (number of embryos per female). We studied populations at 4 different sites, i.e., separate mudflats, for 1-2 years, and estimated variance components at 3 spatial scales: metres (samples), 100s of metres (transects) and many kilometres (mudflats). Population density exhibited low variation between years ({\textless} 10{\%} of the random variation), but showed high variation at our smallest and largest spatial scales (45{\%} between samples. 2{\%} between transects, and 40{\%} between mudflats), i.e., the distribution of C. volutator within a mudflat was aggregated at the scale of metres, but not at that of 100s of metres. Thus, relatively few transects. but many samples per transect, are required for good representation of density on a mudflat. Fecundity was similar between mudflats, but proportion juvenile. sex ratio, and proportion of ovigerous females were strongly affected by site or the interaction between month and site ({\textgreater} 60{\%} of the random variation in each case). The high variation observed between mudflats for most demographic variables demonstrates that several control sites are necessary for measuring natural variation, a critical consideration in studies of environmental impacts.},

abstract = {My thesis explores the link between habitat selection decisions made at the individual level and the resulting population-level distributions, using a combination of field, laboratory, and theoretical studies in mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae). Settlement decisions in MPB depend on complex interactions among the size and nutritional quality of the host tree, its defensive capabilities, beetle attack densities, and beetles' energy reserves. Limited somatic energy reserves and time available for dispersal and habitat search impose restrictions on individuals' settlement decisions, and can have substantial effects on the resulting population distributions. I characterized the variation in individual somatic condition and timing of emergence in a field population of beetles and tested the effect of somatic condition on beetles' habitat settlement decisions. I derived, from first principles, a dynamic state variable model of inter-stand dispersal and tree selection by individual beetles. The model and experimental results showed that considerable individual variation exists and that settlement decisions are modulated both by the beetle's lipid reserves and tree nutritional quality. This model provided the foundation for a spatial dynamic game model of beetle attack on multiple host tree species. I examined how the predicted evolutionarily stable strategies differ for beetles utilizing different pine species, and examined the resulting population distributions on these different tree species. Finally, using beetle dispersal estimates obtained from the dynamic game model, I explored the spread of an engineered genetic control element through MPB populations and describe how such control may be effective to suppress beetle outbreaks. I discuss the utility of considering individual variation together with state- and condition-dependent behaviours in assessing population-level phenomena.},

It was not the first accolade for the unique wilderness area, but arguably the most prestigious. In its nomination, the World Heritage Convention requests the two countries to strengthen cooperation within the African-Eurasian Flyways, a system of global connectedness by migrant waterbirds in which the Wadden Sea plays a vital role. Here we review the origin and (lack of) implementation of the international conservation instruments available to protect values that are easily undervalued and forgotten, instruments that involve cooperation along the flyway axes. We describe how scientific information sometimes helps governments to implement their obligations, but also how, in spite of indisputable scientific data, governments take decisions contrary to their obligations under international conservation instruments. In some cases such decisions are reversed after scientists have shown measurable declines in the global populations of the migratory waterbirds and established the causality of such declines. At a global level, a few more regional flyway conservation instruments may be needed, but for most parts of the world the instrumentation to secure the well-being of the flyways are in place. It boils down to the determination by governments, informed by good science and under close scrutiny by NGOs, to put them into concrete action. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We investigated phylogeographic divergence among populations of Gal{\'{a}}pagos warble finches. Their broad distribution, lack of phenotypic differentiation and low levels of genetic divergence make warbler finches an appropriate model to study speciation in allopatry. A positive relationship between genetic and geographical distance is expected for island taxa. Warbler finches actually showed a negative isolation by distance relationship, causing us to reject the hypothesis of distance-limited dispersal. An alternative hypothesis, that dispersal is limited by habitat similarity, was supported. We found a positive correlation between genetic distances and differences in maximum elevation among islands, which is an indicator of ecological similarity. MtDNA sequence variation revealed monophyletic support for two distinct species. Certhidea olivacea have recently dispersed among larger central islands, while some Certhidea fusca have recently dispersed to small islands at opposite ends of the archipelago. We conclude that females have chosen to breed on islands with habitats similar to their natal environment. Habitat selection is implicated as an important component of speciation of warbler finches, which is the earliest known divergence of the adaptive radiation of Darwin's finches. These results suggest that small populations can harbour cryptic but biologically meaningful variation that may affect longer term evolutionary processes.},

abstract = {A descriptive study was conducted on a dense intertidal population of the infaunal bivalve Cerastoderma edule in the Danish Wadden Sea to investigate effects of submersion time and intraspecific density on recruitment and shell growth. Following a severe winter (1981/82), a successful settlement occurred in June-July 1982. Spat numbers varied along the tidal gradient. At the end of July they reached a maximum density of about 60 000 ind.m-2 in the lower intertidal zone. Their abundance declined rapidly during the following two months. After that the mortality rate was low and in the lower intertidal zone 2500 ind.m-2 survived to the age of 2. Recruitment was insignificant both in 1983 and 1984, probably due to the high standing stock of cockles born in 1982. The distribution pattern of cockles along the tidal transect established during settlement in July 1982 existed until the population vanished in the severe winter of 1984/85. The spat grew from settlement until mid-September and resumed growth during the following spring and early summer. The mean length attained by the cockles after 3 growing seasons at the station with the largest cockles was only 18.4 mm, which is far below lengths recorded elsewhere. Annual growth rates of individual cockles generally showed an increase with increasing submersion time, in particular during their second growing season. In their third year, however, growth rate was extremely low at the station with the highest density. Intraspecific competition among cockles is suspected to be a major cause of such growth rates exhibited by cockles at high densities ({\textgreater}2000.m-2) both during the present study and an earlier (1932-34) study in this area by Thamdrup. Cockles in nearby low-density populations showed higher growth rates, reaching mean lenghts of more than 26 mm after 2 or 3 growing seasons.},

abstract = {A simple food chain model of community structure was used to evaluate the roles of bottom-up and top-down factors in a rocky intertidal community. Predictions of the model were modified to incorporate known variation in the strength of species interactions and nutrient delivery rates along a wave-exposure gradient. To test the predictions of the model, I manipulated nutrients and consumers in tide pools chiseled into mudstone benches at two sites that varied in degree of wave exposure. The pools were located in the mid-intertidal zone between similar to1 and 1.5 m above mean lower low water (MLLW), at Boiler Bay, Oregon, USA. The focal organisms were the benthic macroalgae acid mobile invertebrate herbivores that dominate naturally occurring tide pools at this site. I manipulated nutrient levels and the abundance of herbivores in these tide pools in a fully factorial randomized block design replicated six times at a wave-exposed and a wave-protected site. The experiment was maintained for two years (1994-1996). The abundances of herbivores and macroalgae were monitored in the spring, summer, and fall of each year. I measured primary productivity in the tide pools during the summer. Herbivores had a negative impact on algal abundance. The total effect of herbivory, and the efficiency of herbivores per se, on algal abundance was lower at the wave-exposed site. Nutrient additions had a positive effect on algal abundance, but this effect was reduced at the wave-exposed site. Nutrients also appeared to increase algal productivity, but only where herbivore abundance was low. Algal abundance patterns were generally consistent with model predictions For bottom-up, top-down, and hydrodynamic effects. In contrast to model predictions, herbivore abundance did not respond to the nutrient treatment. The decoupling of consumers from resource dynamics is interpreted to be the result of an herbivore preference for noncalcified seaweeds with higher potential growth rates. In wave-protected pools, where nutrients were most limiting and consumers were most efficient, seaweeds with the potential to translate elevated nutrient levels into growth had no effective refuge from consumers. The difference in scale between resource patches (tide pools) and the foraging range of the dominant herbivore, Tegula funebralis, may have augmented the ability of this herbivore to virtually exclude fleshy seaweeds from wave-protected pools. Expanding the domain of applicability of food chain models requires the incorporation of consumer preferences, variation in plant growth rates, environmental gradients, and differences in the relative scales of resource patches and Foraging ranges of consumers.},

abstract = {We studied the composition, density, size distribution and biomass of the food supply for waders in an estuarine area in the Bay of Cadiz (SW Iberian Peninsula), in winter (January-February) and in the pre-migratory period (late March). The estuarine area comprises an intertidal mudflat and an adjacent salina or salt-pan. On the intertidal mudflat, the biomass was 53 and 37 g AFDW.m(-2) in winter and the pre-migratory period, respectively. The main food source on mudflat was the polychaete Nereis diversicolor (44-54 {\%} of the total biomass). On the other hand, the biomass in the salina was comparatively very poor, ranging from 0.008 to 0.079 g AFDW.m(-2) in winter and ranging from 0.011 to 0.09 g AFDW in late March. The main source of food in the salina was the crustacean Artemia. The total biomass on the mudflat during the pre-migratory period was 1.4 times lower than in February. This depletion could be caused by wader predation, mainly by Nereis diversicolor consumption. Although the potential food on the mudflats could allow high intertidal densities of waders, the availability of high tide foraging areas in the salina seems to contribute to the maintenance of these high intertidal densities.

abstract = {Individual-based models (IBMs) are based on the explicit representation of individual organisms. They are developed for questions where individual variability, local interactions, and adaptive behavior are essential to get the right answers. IBMs are more complex than other mathematical models. Both their complexity and their uncertainty in model structure and parameters are a challenge, but new approaches exist that help meet these challenges. These approaches are based on multiple patterns, observed in the real systems at different scales and hierarchical levels. Patterns indirectly provide information about the systems' internal organization. The task of the modeler is to decode this information. Specific software libraries and modeling platforms exist to implement IBMs as computer programs. Analyzing IBMs requires considering patterns, to define currencies for comparisons of alternative models and parametrizations, and to perform controlled simulation experiments. Robustness analyses then help identify insights that can be generalized beyond the specific system that has been modeled. Three IBMs from the literature are briefly presented as examples of pragmatic and paradigmatic models of animal and plant populations and communities. IBMs will continue being an integral part of ecological modeling and further important general insights of Individual-based Ecology are to be expected, in particular, once standards for model design, implementation, analysis, and communication get established.},

abstract = {During the migratory season, the metabolism of night migrants has to deal with three main physiological situations and their transitions: (1) feeding during the day for fat deposition, (2) overnight fasting during stop-over and (3) nocturnal flight. Plasma metabolite levels of glucose, uric acid, triglycerides, free fatty acids, glycerol and beta-hydroxy-butyrate (beta-OHB) were used in Principal Component Analyses to determine independent factors which characterize these physiological situations and allowed the comparison of three species of night migrants: Garden Warbler Sylvia borin, Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca and European Robin Erithacus rubecula. During overnight fasting, all three species had a low fat metabolism and protein catabolism. During feeding, birds showed high triglyceridc and uric acid levels. During flight, birds were characterized by a high tat metabolism and protein breakdown with the particular feature of having high triglyceride levels. Differences among species during flight suggest that the Garden Warbler showed the most specialized metabolic adaptations to endurance flight relying most strongly on fat and having the highest body fat reserves. The Robin showed the opposite pattern and the pattern of the Pied Flycatcher was intermediate. Birds in transition between the main physiological situations were characterized by a low glucose/beta-OHB ratio.},

abstract = {Provisioners capture items both for delivery and for self-feeding. In doing so, they may travel directly to and from a single location, visit several patches on each excursion from a delivery point, or alternate excursions to different destinations. Prey suitable for self-feeding versus delivery have differing attributes, which means that they are often best sought in different places. Visiting separate patches to self-feed and to load prey for delivery requires more travel time than foraging for both types of prey at a single location, but both self-feeding and loading are faster if carried out in the most suitable patches. Here, we investigate how the distribution of different types of food resources around a central delivery point affects the routine with which a provisioner visits patches to forage. Our results show that each of several basic travel routines is best in some broad region of a parameter space that considers the loading time saved in relation to the extra travel time required. This framework provides a simple explanation for the variety of routines observed in nature and can additionally account for the circumstances under which provisioners concentrate loads for delivery by internal processing, known in some seabirds.},

abstract = {On the offshore island Helgoland, passerine birds killed by predators (feral cats Felis catus and raptors, mainly sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus) during stopover were measured and weighed when found freshly killed and still intact. Supplemented by data of migrating birds ringed on Helgoland and predated on the island later on, age and body mass of victims were compared to live birds trapped on Helgoland during ringing operations. In the eleven species considered, most predator kills fell within the lightest 20{\%} of birds measured during ringing, regardless of which type of predator was involved. It seems that the risk of being heavy due to fuel loads with respect to reduced escape performance is overestimated. The higher exposure of light birds due to more intense foraging and displacement to suboptimal habitats is probably of higher biological significance by offering conspicuous prey for predators. The lower risk of heavy birds when prey of different body condition is available for predators has implications for modelling optimal migration behaviour, and predation risk is perhaps not an important factor for migrants when deciding on site use.

We show that the effect of group size on the relation between foraging efficiency and individual vigilance is mainly correlational, whereas other factors such as competition for food betwen group members might play an important role. We discuss the structure of scanning patterns. Scanning patterns show sequential predictability whose function remains unexplored. Scanning behaviour is more complex than assumed in current models of vigilance and we suggest that duration and shape of scanning movements are particularly important. We propose to study vigilance as a general process of acquisition of information rather than to limit it to the only detection of predators.},

abstract = {The butterfly fauna at Willow Slough, Yolo County, California has been censused for 32. years as part of a participatory citizen-science project, the Fourth of July Butterfly Count. While the utility of a once-a-year census as a monitoring tool is potentially compromised by lack of standardization in counting protocols and variation in observer skill, at Willow Slough these issues have been minimized.We examined the Willow Slough count data for trends in both faunal diversity and the probability of presence of individual species. During the study, the number of species observed at a visit declined by 39{\%}. Regressions of per-visit species counts against time did not detect a statistically significant decline until year 24. In contrast, Fisher's ??, a statistic designed to reduce sample-size bias, detected the decline as early as year 13. Twelve of the 24 species analyzed showed significant declines in probability of occurrence; a further nine exhibited negative but non-significant trends. Butterflies that overwinter as eggs or larvae were more likely to decline than those that overwinter as pupae or adults. Many species in decline at Willow Slough have also been observed less frequently at nearby sites which are monitored year-round, supporting the value of once-a-year monitoring. Although correlations with climatic data have been identified, they are too weak to account for the observed faunal decline. We suspect broader patterns of land use and habitat continuity are implicated in butterfly declines across the region.We conclude that once-a-year sampling, if properly and rigorously done, is in fact useful as a monitoring tool for butterfly faunas, and that Fisher's ?? is well suited to early detection of trends in repeated diversity sampling. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Southward migration through Fundy extends from 1 July to 11 November, although the main passage usually occurs between 20 July and 20 September. Shorebirds are most numerous during August. The average length of stay for the Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) is 15 days.

abstract = {Greenland white-fronted geese Anser albifrons flavirostris wintering in Britain and Ireland migrate over the sea for 700-1200 km to stage 3-5 weeks in Iceland in spring, continuing a similar distance over the sea and Greenland Ice Cap to West Greenland breeding grounds. During 1969 to 2012, the geese advanced the mean departure date from Ireland by 15 days, during which time also they attained threshold fat stores earlier as well as departing in fatter condition. Over that period, Iceland spring-staging geese shifted from consuming underground plant storage organs to grazing managed hayfields, which provide fresh grass growth despite sub-zero temperatures, when traditional natural foods are inaccessible in frozen substrates. In 2012 and 2013, geese arrived three weeks earlier to Iceland, in fatter condition and accumulated fat significantly slower than in 1997-1999 and 2007. Although geese accumulated sufficient fat stores earlier in Iceland in 2007, 2012 and 2013, they departed around the same date as in 1997-1999, prolonging spring staging by three weeks. Plasticity in winter departure dates is likely due to improved winter feeding conditions (enabling earlier departure in better condition) and a novel predictable food resource in Iceland. Greenland white-fronted geese attained threshold fat stores in Iceland earlier, but remained rather than departing earlier to Greenland. Despite arriving earlier in Iceland, arrival dates on the breeding areas have not changed since the 1880s, presumably because of relatively constant cool springs and heavy snowfall in West Greenland during recent years. {\textcopyright} 2014 Current Zoology.},

abstract = {The Arctic is an extremely inhospitable region for most of the year, but during the summer months it bursts with life. A major proportion of avian species nesting in the Arctic are shorebirds (order Charadriiformes; suborder Charadrii). They migrate thousands of kilometers from their wintering grounds to take advantage of abundant food resources each summer and display a variety of migratory strategies. In an attempt to classify this variation, not only between spring and autumn migration, but within a migration, we present four categories. These relate to the distance a species generally flies between stopovers: short distance bout, intermediate distance bout, long distance bout, and combinations. We then explore further differences between spring and autumn migration. Spring migrants experience poor weather and decreased food availability as they fly north. Many cope with huge flocks, which serve as protection from predators, but may also reduce foraging efficiency and increase aggression. In contrast, autumn migrants generally encounter favorable weather and ample food. Flock sizes are usually smaller, thus foraging efficiency is higher and aggression lower than during spring migration. Physiologically, spring migrants are preparing for breeding and reproductive hormones are secreted. In the Western Sandpiper (Calidris mauri), luteinizing hormone levels are higher for spring than autumn migrants. Late spring migrants have higher testosterone levels than either early spring migrants or autumn migrants. Corticosterone levels are also higher in spring vs. autumn migrants. Although spring and autumn migrants travel similar distances, their strategies differ behaviorally and physiologically.},

Sea eagles affect seabirds both directly (by taking adults and offspring and by inducing potentially costly behaviors to minimize danger) and indirectly (by facilitating the nest predators of seabirds, mainly gulls and corvids). Repeated disturbance by hunting eagles has caused seabirds to abandon colonies and subcolonies in the tens to hundreds of thousands of pairs. In recent years, sea eagles have been widely implicated in local declines of surface-nesting seabirds in the northeast Pacific Ocean, the northwest Atlantic Ocean and northern Europe. The extent to which recent events simply reflect a return to a more “natural” ecological baseline as sea eagle populations recover from decades of persecution and chemical pollutants is discussed. We argue that there is need for a research effort to investigate the conservation implications of increasing sea eagles in the context of multiple threats to seabird populations.},

Through a factorial field experiment, we tested the effects of wetland restoration, via tree removal and damming, on egg and juvenile survival of a locally rare butterfly, Satyrodes appalachia. Tree removal more than tripled S. appalachia host plant abundance, but neither restoration action directly affected S. appalachia egg and juvenile survival. Instead, we found strong indirect effects of habitat manipulation on S. appalachia egg and juvenile survival, mediated through predation. The interaction of tree removal and damming significantly decreased predation of S. appalachia eggs relative to each treatment alone. Damming alone had a significant positive indirect effect on the survival of S. appalac...},

Redistribution kernels have been measured for a tremendous number of organisms. We derive a number of redistribution kernels from first principles. Integrodifference equations generate pattern under a far broader set of ecological conditions than do reaction-diffusion models.

abstract = {Migratory animals are comprised of a complex series of interconnected breeding and nonbreeding populations. Because individuals in any given population can arrive from a variety of sites the previous season, predicting how different populations will respond to environmental change can be challenging. In this study, we develop a population model composed of a network of breeding and wintering sites to show how habitat loss affects patterns of connectivity and species abundance. When the costs of migration are evenly distributed, habitat loss at a single site can increase the degree of connectivity (mixing) within the entire network, which then acts to buffer global populations from declines. However, the degree to which populations are buffered depends on where habitat loss occurs within the network: a site that has the potential to receive individuals from multiple populations in the opposite season will lead to smaller declines than a site that is more isolated. In other cases when there are equal costs of migration to two or more sites in the opposite season, habitat loss can result in some populations becoming segregated (disconnected) from the rest of the network. The geographic structure of the network can have a significant influence on relative population sizes of sites in the same season and can also affect the overall degree of mixing in the network, even when sites are of equal intrinsic quality. When a migratory network is widely spaced and migration costs are high, an equivalent habitat loss will lead to a larger decline in global population size than will occur in a network where the overall costs of migration are low. Our model provides an important foundation to test predictions related to habitat loss in real-world migratory networks and demonstrates that migratory networks will likely produce different dynamics from traditional metapopulations. Our results provide strong evidence that estimating population connectivity is a prerequisite for successfully predicting changes in migratory populations.},

abstract = {1. Game theoretic models of how animals manage predation risk have begun to describe predator responses to prey behaviour relatively recently. This is partly because our understanding of how terrestrial predators select vertebrate prey is often limited to numerical and functional responses to measures of prey abundance. Prey vulnerability, however, may improve our understanding of predation because predators could maximize foraging success by selecting prey on this basis. 2. We tested the hypothesis that sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus L.), a typical generalist predator, hunt redshanks (Tringa totanus L.), a favoured prey species on coastal shores, primarily on the basis of their vulnerability rather than their abundance. 3. Five direct measures or indicators of redshank behaviour predicted sparrowhawk attack success in a multipredictor statistical model and therefore serve as measures of redshank vulnerability. 4. These and other vulnerability measures influenced whether sparrowhawks decided to hunt redshanks on saltmarsh habitat. A model that included most of these measures predicted correctly whether sparrowhawks hunted redshanks (attack decision) 90{\%} of the time and accounted for up to 75{\%} of variation. Prey abundance accounted for no additional variation. 5. Thus the hunting behaviour of some predators can only be predicted well by several highly dynamic and interacting factors related to prey vulnerability. These results mean that, theoretically at least, the management of prey populations may sometimes be achieved best by manipulating prey vulnerability, rather than by culling their predators.},

abstract = {Using optimality perspectives is now regarded as an essential way of analysing and understanding adaptations and behavioural strategies in bird migration. Optimization analyses in bird migration research have diversified greatly during the two recent decades with respect to methods used as well as to topics addressed. Methods range from simple analytical and geometric models to more complex modeling by stochastic dynamic programming, annual routine models and multiobjective optimization. Also, game theory and simulation by selection algorithms have been used. A wide range of aspects of bird migration have been analyzed including flight, fuel deposition, predation risk, stopover site use, transition to breeding, routes and detours, daily timing, fly-and-forage migration, wind selectivity and wind drift, phenotypic flexibility, arrival time and annual molt and migration schedules. Optimization analyses have proven to be particularly important for defining problems and specifying questions and predictions about the consequences of minimization of energy, time and predation risk in bird migration. Optimization analyses will probably also be important in the future, when predictions about bird migration strategies can be tested by much new data obtained by modern tracking techniques and when the importance of new trade-offs, associated with, e.g., digestive physiology, metabolism, immunocompetence and disease, need to be assessed in bird migration research.},

abstract = {Dunlin migration in northeast Italy is described. An attempt to identify the main routes and staging areas used by birds wintering in the central Mediterranean is presented. The results of monthly counts from 1990-1995 revealed that the bulk of the population occupied the wintering area in October and left for the breeding grounds in April and May. The analysis of 342 Italian recoveries of foreign ringed birds showed that 65{\%} were ringed during post-breeding migration through the Baltic Sea, whereas just a few birds had been ringed in western Europe. First-year birds arrived in autumn with a single migratory wave, peaking in October Two categories of adults were identified during post-breeding migration: birds which directly reached Italian wintering sites and birds which arrived after they had suspended their migration for moulting: the Azov/Black Sea wetlands are suggested as possible moulting areas. Out of 2444 adults and 1627 first-years ringed between 1989 and 1996 at our study area, we obtained a total of 42 recoveries abroad and evidence of direct links between Azov/Black Sea and N Adriatic wetlands, both during autumn and spying migrations. Primary moult was observed only in adults arriving early the second migratory wave being composed of moulted birds. Locally moulting adults adopted a moult strategy characterized by high raggedness scores, typical of resident moulters. Body mass was not affected by primary moult stage or intensity, winter mass values being reached two weeks after the average date of primary moult completion.},

abstract = {Nutrient supply is widely thought to regulate primary production of many ecosystems including salt marshes. However, experimental manipulation of the dominant marsh grazer (the periwinkle, Littoraria irrorata) and its consumers (e.g., blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, terrapins, Malaclemys terrapin) demonstrates plant biomass and production are largely controlled by grazers and their predators. Periwinkle grazing can convert one of the most productive grasslands in the world into a barren mudflat within 8 months. Marine predators regulate the abundance of this plant-grazing snail. Thus, top-down control of grazer density is a key regulatory determinant of marsh grass growth. The discovery of this simple trophic cascade implies that over-harvesting of snail predators (e.g., blue crabs) may be an important factor contributing to the massive die-off (tens of km(2)) of salt marshes across the southeastern United States. In addition, our results contribute to a growing body of evidence indicating widespread, predator regulation of marine macrophyte production via trophic cascades (kelps, seagrasses, intertidal algae).},

abstract = {Conservation objectives for non-breeding coastal birds (shorebirds and wildfowl) are determined from their population size at coastal sites. To advise coastal managers, models must predict quantitatively the effects of environmental change on population size or the demographic rates (mortality and reproduction) that determine it. As habitat association models and depletion models are not able to do this, we developed an approach that has produced such predictions thereby enabling policy makers to make evidence-based decisions. Our conceptual framework is individual-based ecology, in which populations are viewed as having properties (e.g. size) that arise from the traits (e.g. behaviour, physiology) and interactions of their constituent individuals. The link between individuals and populations is made through individual-based models (IBMs) that follow the fitness-maximising decisions of individuals and predict population-level consequences (e.g. mortality rate) from the fates of these individuals. Our first IBM was for oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus and accurately predicted their density-dependent mortality. Subsequently, IBMs were developed for several shorebird and wildfowl species at several European sites, and were shown to predict accurately overwinter mortality, and the foraging behaviour from which predictions are derived. They have been used to predict the effect on survival in coastal birds of sea level rise, habitat loss, wind farm development, shellfishing and human disturbance. This review emphasises the wider applicability of the approach, and identifies other systems to which it could be applied. We view the IBM approach as a very useful contribution to the general problem of how to advance ecology to the point where we can routinely make meaningful predictions of how populations respond to environmental change.},

abstract = {The rate of chick growth in high-latitude breeding shorebirds is rapid, but little is known about the effect of chick mass, growth, and brood movements on subsequent brood survival. To address these topics, we monitored chick growth patterns, daily brood movements, and survival of Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska. We assessed the effect of chick age, mass, and hatch date on brood survival using Program MARK. We mapped brood locations daily, and compared brood movement patterns between successful and unsuccessful broods. Younger chicks survived at lower rates and moved shorter distances than older chicks. The overall probability of one or more chicks from a brood surviving to 15 days of age was 0.73 +/- 0.05 SE. Brood survival declined seasonally, and broods with heavier chicks survived at higher rates than those with lighter chicks. On average, successful broods fledged 1.7 +/- 0.1 SE chicks. Rate of chick growth was intermediate between those of high arctic and temperate-breeding shorebirds, and chick mass at hatching declined seasonally. Western Sandpiper brood survival was lowest when chicks were young, spatially clumped, and unable to maintain homeothermy, probably because young chicks were more vulnerable to both complete depredation events and extreme weather. Our data suggest that larger, older chicks are able to avoid predators by being spatially dispersed and highly mobile; thermal independence, achieved after approximately day five, enables chicks to better endure prolonged periods of cold and low food availability.},

One type of bias, known as “p-hacking,” occurs when researchers collect or select data or statistical analyses until nonsignificant results become significant. Here, we use text-mining to demonstrate that p-hacking is widespread throughout science. We then illustrate how one can test for p-hacking when performing a meta-analysis and show that, while p-hacking is probably common, its effect seems to be weak relative to the real effect sizes beingmeasured. This result suggests that p-hacking probably does not drastically alter scientific consensuses drawn from meta-analyses.},

abstract = {Impacts of climate change on biological systems include shifts in seasonal phenology. How do migratory animals adjust reproductive decisions as they shift timing of breeding? I investigated patterns of climate change at a network of Arctic sites in Alaska and Canada, and examined the impacts of climate change on the breeding phenology, reproductive performance, and trophic interactions of Arctic-breeding shorebirds. First, I compared the breeding performance of three species, Western Sandpiper, Semipalmated Sandpiper, and Red-necked Phalaropes, at Nome, Alaska, across a 14-year interval. I found that shorebirds responded to a decreasing temperature during laying by delaying timing of breeding. Delayed breeding shortened the incubation duration for two biparental species but extended incubation for a uniparental species. Despite a short Arctic summer, the breeding windows of three sympatric species were temporally distinct. The three species often nested within several meters from each other, but bred under different temperature regimes and adjusted their reproductive output to different sets of environmental factors. Shifts in breeding phenology can disrupt trophic interactions, especially the phenological match between peak prey availability and hatching of shorebirds. Comparing the extent of phenological mismatch between six shorebirds and their invertebrate prey at ten Arctic sites, peak demand of shorebird broods occurred on average 3.8 days (± 13.8) later than local food peaks, and population demand curves overlapped with food curves by 47{\%} (± 14{\%}). Latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in the extent of trophic mismatch were mediated through geographic variation in the seasonal phenology of invertebrates and shorebirds. For individual nests, both more northerly and easterly sites showed greater phenological mismatch with annual food peaks. Delayed emergence of food peaks at more northerly and easterly sites alleviated the extent of phenological mismatch. My multi-site study provides the first evidence that large-scale geographic processes can determine the extent of phenological mismatch in a bitrophic system. Trends of climate change are sensitive to breeding stages and also vary along a longitudinal gradient. Variability in climatic trends in the Arctic, combined with species-dependent responses to local climate change, indicate that it will be challenging to predict the impacts of future climate change.},

abstract = {The influence of prey activity on the use of intertidal flats by foraging waders is largely unknown. Due to differences in sediment drainage some flats remain covered by a layer of water during much of the exposed part of the tidal cycle, whereas others drain soon after the passage of the tidal line. Invertebrate prey may respond to the presence of water over the sediment, so their activity is likely to vary throughout exposure and among differently drained sites. Because active prey tend to be more conspicuous to predators, sediment drainage may also influence the foraging behaviour and intertidal flat use by waders. Using video recordings and controlled drainage experiments, we studied how the activity of the two most important wader prey in the Tagus estuary, Hediste diversicolor Malmgren and Scrobicularia plana (da Costa), is influenced by sediment drainage, and how it varies throughout the exposed part of the tidal cycle. H. diversicolor was far more active in well drained sediments and at later phases of the exposure period. In contrast, activity of S. plana peaked in early phases of exposure but declined quickly as the sediment drained, except when poor drainage maintained a thin water layer. In concordance with these results, wader species that feed extensively on S. plana in the Tagus tend to follow the tidal line and concentrate on poorly drained areas, while those that prefer H. diversicolor are not tide-followers and remain on well drained areas. This agreement suggests that sediment drainage and associated prey rhythms greatly influence wader foraging patterns on sediment flats. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Animal personality has been proposed to emerge as an adaptation to individual differences in state variables, leading to the question of why individuals differ consistently in state. Recent theory emphasizes the role that positive feedbacks between state and behaviour can play in producing consistent among-individual covariance between state and behaviour, hence state-dependent personality. We review the role of feedbacks in recent models of adaptive personalities, and provide guidelines for empirical testing of model assumptions and predictions. We discuss the importance of the mediating effects of ecology on these feedbacks, and provide a roadmap for including state-behaviour feedbacks in behavioural ecology research.},

abstract = {Foraging rate and the distribution of foragers depend on prey distribution in conjunction with interindividual interactions. Generalized functional response models predict intake rates and spatial distributions of foragers on the basis of resource distribution and interference competition. The adequacy of these models depends on how well they capture the foragers' essential behavior. In this paper, we report on the results of a foraging experiment designed to examine the mechanisms of interference competition using red knots Calidris canutus that feed on buried bivalves. Red knots are rarely observed to interfere in the field, but this does not imply absence of interference. Our experimental setup minimized resource depletion, which allowed us to quantify interference competition as the decline in intake rate as a function of group size, with prey density and social status as additional treatments. We found that intake rate and searching efficiency decreased with group size and that dominant birds had higher intake rates than subordinates. Additionally, time spent searching for prey increased with group size. The decrease in intake rate was not due to conventional interference mechanisms (such as kleptoparasitism and time spent interacting with conspecifics) but to "cryptic interference," that is, avoidance of physical encounters with conspecifics. To accurately predict intake rates and foraging distributions, theory and models need to account for the possibility that animals anticipate and try to avoid, at some costs, physical encounters with conspecifics (i.e., conflicts that would make conventional interference behavior visible).},

Here they molt the rest of their body feathers and all flight feathers, before continuing on to the winter range in western Mexico. Hatching-year birds undergo a limited prebasic molt on the breeding grounds and then stop during migration at one of the same two hotspots to undergo a nearly complete presupplemental molt of all body and most flight feathers. Some individuals of both age classes also migrate directly to western Mexico to molt on the wintering grounds. A possible cause of the interrupted migration strategy is the combination of dry, food-scarce conditions on the breeding range and locally rainy, food-rich conditions at the molting stopovers from late August through October.},

Migratory species often winter over large geographic ranges, and individuals in different locations experience very different environmental conditions, including different migration costs, which can potentially create fitness inequalities. Here we used energetics models to quantify the trade-offs experienced by a migratory shorebird species at locations throughout the nonbreeding range, and the associated consequences for migratory performance, survival, and breeding habitat quality. Individuals experiencing more favorable winter conditions had higher survival rates, arrived on the breeding grounds earlier, and occupied better quality breeding areas, even when migration costs are substantially higher, than individuals from locations where the energy balance on the wintering grounds was less favorable. The energy costs and benefits of occupying different winter locations can therefore create fitness inequalities which can shape the distribution and population-wide demography of migratory species.},

abstract = {Patch use under predation risk requires animals to trade off needs for safety and food. I consider within a common framework four ways of modeling how safety and energy inﬂuence fitness. These models make similar predictions for when a forager should stop feeding from depletable patches that vary in predation risk. In accord with Brown (1988), patches should be abandoned when the harvest rate no longer compensates for the metabolic, predation, and missed opportunity costs of foraging. In accord with Gilliam {\&} Fraser (1987), safe and risky patches should be left at the same ratio of predation risk to net feeding rate when the alternative activities include resting in a safe refuge to save energy. The quitting harvest rate of the forager within a food patch should be sensitive to predation risk and to the marginal value of food (the fitness value of an additional food item). Quitting harvest rates should be higher in food patches with higher predation risk. Quitting harvest rates and the costs of predation should increase as the marginal value of food decreases. The difference in quitting harvest rates between patches with high and low predation risk should increase as the marginal value of food decreases. Fortunately, the shared qualitative predictions of these models have and can be tested. Unfortunately, distinguishing among the models' differing quantitative predictions shall prove challenging.},

abstract = {Indices to population size have come under increasing criticism in recent years, on the grounds that indices might not faithfully represent the entire population. Most criticisms involve surveys of birds, particularly those based on point counts, which is my focus here. A variety of quantitative methods have been developed to reduce the bias of point counts, such as distance sampling, multiple-observer surveys, and time-of-detection methods. I argue that these developments are valuable, in that they enhance understanding of the detection process, but that their practical application may well be limited, likely to intensive studies focusing on a small number of species. These quantitative methods are not generally applicable to extensive, multiple-species surveys. Although criticism of the thoughtless use of indices is welcome, their wholesale rejection is not.},

abstract = {Crossing large bodies of water can be extremely risky for terrestrial migrants and yet such migrants have been observed to cross hundreds and even thousands of kilometres of water. However, the mechanisms that enable nocturnal migrants to cross large bodies of water successfully remain unclear. In the north of the Netherlands, autumn migration of birds occurs mainly along a southwesterly axis and can be predicted very successfully. However, on rare occasions, intense and unexpected migration events occur with a significantly different track direction. We hypothesized that these events represent birds arriving from Norway and other Scandinavian countries after crossing the North Sea barrier. We implemented a back-trajectory model calibrated with radar data from autumn 2006-2008 to test our hypothesis, assuming that birds maintain a constant heading and airspeed during flight. A total of 14 events were identified. In some cases measured mean ground speeds were twice as high as mean airspeeds. Model results demonstrated that birds took advantage of atmospheric conditions to cross the North Sea quickly. In the majority of cases, birds could be tracked to Norway, Denmark or Sweden when maintaining a constant airspeed and heading en route, but not in all cases. Thus migrants must be flexible in their reaction to wind to take advantage of dynamic and heterogeneous atmospheric conditions experienced en route. The integration of measurements with simulation modelling provides a powerful framework to improve our understanding of how animals move through a dynamic environment and the consequences of their behaviour. ?? 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Hypothesis: The ecological theory of adaptive radiation predicts divergent morphological adaptations to different environments, and different evolutionary trait utilities in varying environments. Organism: Darwin's Small Ground Finch (Geospiza fuliginosa). Times and places: Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos Archipelago, in two study areas of different habitat type: highland forest (c. 500 m elevation) and lowland arid zone (c. 50 m elevation). The two contiguous populations of Darwin's finches were separated by a flight distance of 18 km. Data were collected from both study areas between November and March in the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2004. Analytical methods: This natural experiment examined two contiguous populations for evidence of the first phase of speciation, namely adaptive divergence in morphological parameters between environments. We used mist-netting to capture and then measure birds between habitat types, and observational methods to record foraging behaviour. Foraging behaviour was recorded as a single observation per bird that was observed along transects through the study plots. Morphology data for beak and foot dimensions were analysed separately, and as principal components factor scores, and were compared between habitats and years. Results: Birds in the lowlands of Santa Cruz Island differed significantly from birds in the highlands in foot dimensions (longer foot and claws) and beak size (shorter beak). Lowland birds spent more time foraging on the ground, and used the foraging techniques of picking and chipping at prey with their beak, and scratching the ground with their feet, whereas highland birds tended to forage in low vegetation, sliding their longer beaks through vegetation to remove seeds. This study is the first to document adaptive divergence in clinal populations of Darwin's finches. These findings highlight the role that adaptive response to ecological gradients has over relatively short distances in contiguous populations. The findings also generate testable hypotheses about species richness in lineages that show morphological differences within clines. {\textcopyright} 2006 Sonia Kleindorfer.},

abstract = {Shells were broken experimentally by compressive and compactional loading to determine the best predictors of shell strength among a number of morphologic (length, width, height, weight, thickness) and taphonomic (presence of a drillhole, exposure to seawater, point contacts of shells) features. Compressive strength of fresh (Mercenaria mercenaria, Mytilus edulis) and beach-collected (Anadara ovalis) shells was measured by placing a single valve flat on a surface and compressing it. Compactional strength of beach-collected Mulinia lateralis shells was measured by placing isolated valves and shell layers in fine sand and compacting the sand and shell mixture. The most effective predictor of compressive shell strength of fresh shells was thickness; it was significant for all three species and it easily can be interpreted as an obvious defense against a shell-crushing predator. Size was comparatively less important. The presence of a drillhole reduced shell strength significantly, and strong correlations of weight and shell strength among beach collected Anadara shells may reflect different states of degradation of the original amounts of organic matrix. Supporting this conclusion is the observation that immersion in seawater for seven weeks significantly decreased shell strength of organic-rich shells (Mytilus), but did not affect shell strength of organic-poor shells (Mercenaria). Fracture patterns varied considerably between and within taxa. The breakage pattern of Anadara and Mercenaria shells generally consisted of a set of fractures radiating from the point of loading to the shell margin, including even the thick dorsal margin. The breakage pattern in Mytilus usually consisted of one fracture only, which did not extend from the point of loading but whose path was highly unpredictable. In compaction experiments with beach-collected Mulinia lateralis, the most important factor determining whether or how a shell would break was the contact between shells. Isolated shells, both drilled and undrilled, did not break. Among drilled valves in simulated shell beds, only 26 percent of the fragments {\textgreater} 2 mm fractured through the drillhole.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Over the past 15 yr, an invasive cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, has covered more than 5000 ha of tidal mudflats in Willapa Bay, Washington, threatening key shorebird habitat on the Pacific Flyway. Although chemical and mechanical control methods have been used to manage Spartina in Willapa Bay, little is known about how these methods affect subsequent use by shorebirds and waterfowl. During 2003–2004, four sites were monitored for 10-min periods for use by shorebirds [Dunlin (Calidris alpina), Western Sandpiper (C. mauri), Least Sandpiper (C. minutilla), Black-bellied Plovers (Pluvialis squatarola) and Long-billed and Short-billed dowitchers (Limnodromus sp.)] and waterfowl [Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Gadwall (A. strepera), American Wigeon (A. americana), Green-winged Teal (A. crecca), and Canada Goose (Branta canadensis)]. The four sites were bare mudflat (never infested with Spartina), tilled Spartina meadow (free of live Spartina and dead stubble), herbicide-sprayed Spartina meadow (10{\%} living Spartina and 30{\%} dead stubble), and an untreated Spartina meadow. Untreated Spartina meadow was rarely used by birds, with a mean of seven small Calidris sandpipers (peeps) and 0.8 waterfowl ha−1. Mean numbers of peeps and waterfowl observed using the herbicide-treated Spartina meadow were 62 and 16 ha−1, and the tilled Spartina meadow were 700 and 27 ha−1, respectively. Mean use of the adjacent bare mud site by peeps and waterfowl was 450 and 11 ha−1, respectively. The untreated Spartina meadow, sprayed meadow, tilled meadow and the bare mud site had mean densities of Black-bellied Plovers and dowitchers of 26, 24, 6, and 0 ha−1, and 0.8, 6, 0.3, and 0 ha−1, respectively. Our results demonstrate that, within several years of removal of invasive Spartina from mudflats in a large Washington estuary by either mechanical or chemical means, use by shorebirds and waterfowl will increase dramatically. Durante los {\'{u}}ltimos 15 a{\~{n}}os la yerba invasiva Spartina alterniflora ha cubierto m{\'{a}}s de 5000 ha de lodazales en la Bah{\'{i}}a de Willapa en Washington, amenazando un h{\'{a}}bitat de gran importancia para los playeros que usan la v{\'{i}}a del Pac{\'{i}}fico. Aunque se han utilizado controles qu{\'{i}}micos y mec{\'{a}}nicos para manejar a la yerba, se sabe muy poco de como dichos m{\'{e}}todos afectan el uso subsecuente del {\'{a}}rea por parte de playeros y aves acu{\'{a}}ticas. Durante el 2003–2004, se monitorearon cuatro localidades por periodos de 10 minutos ara determinar el uso de parte de Calidris alpina, C. mauri, C. minutilla, Pluvialis squatarola, Limnodromus sp. y anseriformes tales como Anas platyrhynchos, A. strepera, A. americana, A. crecca y Branta canadensis. Los h{\'{a}}bitats monitoreados incluyen lodazales limpios (nunca cubiertos por Spartina), praderas cultivadas (libres de Spartina viva con organismos muertos), pradera tratada con yerbicida (10{\%} de Spartina viva y 30{\%} de organismos muertos) y lodazal con Spartina sin recibir tratamiento. Las {\'{a}}reas que no fueron tratadas fueron utilizadas muy rara vez, con un promedio de 7 playeros y 0.8 patos por ha. El n{\'{u}}mero promedio de playeros y patos observados en {\'{a}}reas tratadas resulto ser de 62 y 16 ind/ha, respectivamente y en las praderas cultivadas libres de Spartina se encontraron 62 y 16 ind/ha y 700 y 27 ind/ha, respectivamente.

abstract = {Any animal whose form or behavior facilitates the avoidance of predators or escape when attacked by predators will have a greater probability of surviving to breed and therefore greater probability of producing offspring (i.e., fitness). Although in theory the fitness consequences of any antipredation behavior can simply be measured by the resultant probability of survival or death, determining the functional significance of antipredation behavior presents a surprising problem. In this review we draw attention to the problem that fitness consequences of antipredation behaviors cannot be determined without considering the potential for reduction of predation risk, or increased reproductive output, through other compensatory behaviors than the behaviors under study. We believe we have reached the limits of what we can ever understand about the ecological effects of antipredation behavior from empirical studies that simply correlate a single behavior with an apparent fitness consequence. Future empirical studies must involve many behaviors to consider the range of potential compensation to predation risk. This is because antipredation behaviors are a composite of many behaviors that an animal can adjust to accomplish its ends. We show that observed variation in antipredation behavior does not have to reflect fitness and we demonstrate that few studies can draw unambiguous conclusions about the fitness consequences of antipredation behavior. Lastly, we provide suggestions of how future research should best be targeted so that, even in the absence of death rates or changes in reproductive output, reasonable inferences of the fitness consequences of antipredation behaviors can be made.},

The cues used include cast production by Arenicola marina, outflows of water from the holes of Notomastus latericeus and other polychaetes, and swimming movements by small amphipods and isopods. The intertidal polychaetes A. marina and N. latericeus, the amphipod Bathyporeia pelagica and the isopod Eurydice pulchra increased their surface activity in relation to variations in environmental conditions, particularly warmer temperatures. When activity of the surface-living small Crustacea was low, Ringed Plovers used foot-vibration to stimulate movement of these animals, making them visible.},

abstract = {Large mobile predators are hypothesized to fulfill integral roles in structuring marine foodwebs via predation, yet few investigations have actually examined the foraging behavior and impact of these species on benthic prey. Limited studies from the Cape Lookout system implicate large schooling cownose rays (Rhinoptera bonasus) in the devastation of patches of commercially harvested bay scallop via strong density-dependent foraging behavior during migrations through this estuary. However, despite the extensive Atlantic range of R. bonasus, the pervasiveness of their patch-depleting foraging behavior and thus impact on shellfisheries remains unknown outside of North Carolina waters. To further understand the potential impacts of cownose rays on benthic prey and the role of bivalve density in eliciting these impacts, we conducted exclusion and manipulation experiments at two sites in the northern Gulf of Mexico frequented by rays during spring migrations. Despite a correlation in ray abundance with haustorid amphipod (primary natural prey) density at our study sites, we were unable to detect any effect of rays on amphipod densities. In addition, through manipulation of predator access, we determined the main cause of mortality to manipulated patches of hard clams was predation by smaller predators such as Callinectes sapidus and not cownose rays. While cownose rays consume hard clam in other parts of their range, we suggest rays along northern Gulf of Mexico barrier islands may prefer foraging on smaller and thinner-shelled bivalves (e.g., Donax sp.), as well as more abundant amphipod crustaceans. We caution that these preferences may have reduced our ability to detect effects of rays on manipulated prey, and thus future impact experiments should strongly consider the local diet of these predators and explore novel techniques to estimate effects on small crustaceans. Further synchronized experimentation along basin-wide scales may elucidate the environmental factors that determine the severity of cownose ray foraging impacts across their range. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Twenty-six sandpipers carrying miniature radio transmitters on northward migration across the Fraser River delta, British Columbia, remained on or near to the section of beach where they were first detected through their entire stay. They traveled about 4-6 km each day, following the tide up and down the beach. Although some Western Sandpipers were present on all beaches of the delta, our results suggest that individuals do not roam widely once they settle. The widespread distribution of sandpipers in mud, marsh, and sand habitats suggests that all regions of the Fraser River delta are required to support the large number of Western Sandpipers during spring migration.},

abstract = {Foragers use a variety of anti-predator behaviours to increase their safety from predators. While foraging, animals should alter usage within or between sites to balance the benefits of feeding with the costs of predation. I tested how the distribution of food abundance and predation danger interacts to explain spatial usage (i.e. distance from shore) by migratory western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) at Boundary Bay, British Columbia, Canada, during northward and southward migrations. At Boundary Bay there are opposing spatial gradients in the distribution of food abundance and safety from predators. Predation danger for sandpipers is high near the shoreline where there is approach cover for falcons and decreases with distance from shore. Food abundance for sandpipers declines as distance from the shoreline increases. Food and danger attributes at Boundary Bay also differ temporally, such that food abundance is higher during southward migration, and predation danger is higher during northward migration. The spatial usage by western sandpipers balances the tradeoff between the opposing spatial gradients in food and safety. For both migratory periods spatial usage of the mudflat by sandpipers is highest at distances from the shoreline where food abundance and predation danger are intermediate. During the northward migration sandpiper usage is highest between 150 and 500 m from the shoreline, and during the southward migration sandpiper usage is highest between 100 and 600 m from the shoreline. Despite temporal differences in food and danger attributes, spatial usage of the site by sandpipers does not differ between migratory periods. Understanding how the distribution of food abundance and predation danger interact to affect the within site usage by shorebirds has important implications for assessments of site quality.},

abstract = {—The Tofino Wah-nah-jus Hilth-hoo-is Mudflats on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, in-clude both pristine areas and sites with residential and resort development. Shorebird counts were conducted at six sites around these mudflats in 2011 and compared with historical counts from 1988, 1989, and 1995. Temporal trends of counts did not vary among sites with different levels of disturbance. Over the entire mudflats, counts of Dunlin (Calidris alpina) moving northward had a negative trend over time ($\beta$ yr = -0.04), as did counts of Western Sandpiper (Calidris mauri; $\beta$ yr = -0.04), Least Sandpiper (Calidris minutilla; $\beta$ yr = -0.03) and Short-billed Dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus; $\beta$ yr = -0.04) moving southward. In contrast, counts of Black-bellied Plover (Pluvialis squatarola; $\beta$ yr = 0.03) and Semipalmated Plover (Charadrius semipalmatus; $\beta$ yr = 0.02) moving northward increased over time. Counts of Dunlin and Short-billed Dowitcher were lower at disturbed sites relative to non-disturbed sites, indicating that disturbance may be displacing birds away from some sites. Further, counts of northward migrating shorebirds were negatively correlated with the presence of people and dogs at the most disturbed site (Chesterman Beach). Monitoring and precautionary actions to address effects of disturbance at this important stopover site are war-ranted.},

abstract = {As the need grows for conceptualization, formalization, and abstraction in biology, so too does mathematics' relevance to the field (Fagerstr{\"{o}}m et al. 1996). Mathematics is particularly important for analyzing and characterizing random variation of, for example, size and weight of individuals in populations, their sensitivity to chemicals, and time-to-event cases, such as the amount of time an individual needs to recover from illness. The frequency distribution of such data is a major factor determining the type of statistical analysis that can be validly carried out on any data set. Many widely used statistical methods, such as ANOVA (analysis of variance) and regression analysis, require that the data be normally distributed, but only rarely is the frequency distribution of data tested when these techniques are used. The Gaussian (normal) distribution is most often assumed to describe the random variation that occurs in the data from many scientific disciplines; the well-known bell-shaped curve can easily be characterized and described by two values: the arithmetic mean {\textless}private-char description='[xmacr]' name='xmacr' value='xmacr'/{\textgreater} and the standard deviation s, so that data sets are commonly described by the expression {\textless}private-char description='[xmacr]' name='xmacr' value='xmacr'/{\textgreater} ± s. A historical example of a normal distribution is that of chest measurements of Scottish soldiers made by Quetelet, Belgian founder of modern social statistics (Swoboda 1974). In addition, such disparate phenomena as milk production by cows and random deviations from target values in industrial processes fit a normal distribution. However, many measurements show a more or less skewed distribution. Skewed distributions are particularly common when mean values are low, variances large, and values cannot be negative, as is the case, for example, with species abundance, lengths of latent periods of infectious diseases, and distribution of mineral resources in the Earth's crust. Such skewed distributions often closely fit the log-normal distribution (Aitchison and Brown 1957, Crow and Shimizu 1988, Lee 1992, Johnson et al. 1994, Sachs 1997). Examples fitting the normal distribution, which is symmetrical, and the log-normal distribution, which is skewed, are given in Figure 1. Note that body height fits both distributions. Often, biological mechanisms induce log-normal distributions (Koch 1966), as when, for instance, exponential growth is combined with further symmetrical variation: With a mean concentration of, say, 106 bacteria, one cell division more—or less—will lead to 2 × 106—or 5 — 105—cells. Thus, the range will be asymmetrical—to be precise, multiplied or divided by 2 around the mean. The skewed size distribution may be why “exceptionally” big fruit are reported in journals year after year in autumn. Such exceptions, however, may well be the rule: Inheritance of fruit and flower size has long been known to fit the log-normal distribution (Groth 1914, Powers 1936, Sinnot 1937). What is the difference between normal and log-normal variability? Both forms of variability are based on a variety of forces acting independently of one another. A major difference, however, is that the effects can be additive or multiplicative, thus leading to normal or log-normal distributions, respectively. Some basic principles of additive and multiplicative effects can easily be demonstrated with the help of two ordinary dice with sides numbered from 1 to 6. Adding the two numbers, which is the principle of most games, leads to values from 2 to 12, with a mean of 7, and a symmetrical frequency distribution. The total range can be described as 7 plus or minus 5 (that is, 7 ± 5) where, in this case, 5 is not the standard deviation. Multiplying the two numbers, however, leads to values between 1 and 36 with a highly skewed distribution. The total variability can be described as 6 multiplied or divided by 6 (or 6 ×/ 6). In this case, the symmetry has moved to the multiplicative level. Although these examples are neither normal nor log-normal distributions, they do clearly indicate that additive and multiplicative effects give rise to different distributions. Thus, we cannot describe both types of distribution in the same way. Unfortunately, however, common belief has it that quantitative variability is generally bell shaped and symmetrical. The current practice in science is to use symmetrical bars in graphs to indicate standard deviations or errors, and the sign ± to summarize data, even though the data or the underlying principles may suggest skewed distributions (Factor et al. 2000, Keesing 2000, Le Naour et al. 2000, Rhew et al. 2000). In a number of cases the variability is clearly asymmetrical because subtracting three standard deviations from the mean produces negative values, as in the example 100 ± 50. Moreover, the example of the dice shows that the established way to characterize symmetrical, additive variability with the sign ± (plus or minus) has its equivalent in the handy sign ×/ (times or divided by), which will be discussed further below. Log-normal distributions are usually characterized in terms of the log-transformed variable, using as parameters the expected value, or mean, of its distribution, and the standard deviation. This characterization can be advantageous as, by definition, log-normal distributions are symmetrical again at the log level. Unfortunately, the widespread aversion to statistics becomes even more pronounced as soon as logarithms are involved. This may be the major reason that log-normal distributions are so little understood in general, which leads to frequent misunderstandings and errors. Plotting the data can help, but graphs are difficult to communicate orally. In short, current ways of handling log-normal distributions are often unwieldy. To get an idea of a sample, most people prefer to think in terms of the original rather than the log-transformed data. This conception is indeed feasible and advisable for log-normal data, too, because the familiar properties of the normal distribution have their analogies in the log-normal distribution. To improve comprehension of log-normal distributions, to encourage their proper use, and to show their importance in life, we present a novel physical model for generating log-normal distributions, thus filling a 100-year-old gap. We also demonstrate the evolution and use of parameters allowing characterization of the data at the original scale. Moreover, we compare log-normal distributions from a variety of branches of science to elucidate patterns of variability, thereby reemphasizing the importance of log-normal distributions in life. A physical model demonstrating the genesis of log-normal distributions Section: Next section There was reason for Galton (1889) to complain about colleagues who were interested only in averages and ignored random variability. In his thinking, variability was even part of the “charms of statistics.” Consequently, he presented a simple physical model to give a clear visualization of binomial and, finally, normal variability and its derivation. Figure 2a shows a further development of this “Galton board,” in which particles fall down a board and are deviated at decision points (the tips of the triangular obstacles) either left or right with equal probability. (Galton used simple nails instead of the isosceles triangles shown here, so his invention resembles a pinball machine or the Japanese game Pachinko.) The normal distribution created by the board reflects the cumulative additive effects of the sequence of decision points. A particle leaving the funnel at the top meets the tip of the first obstacle and is deviated to the left or right by a distance c with equal probability. It then meets the corresponding triangle in the second row, and is again deviated in the same manner, and so forth. The deviation of the particle from one row to the next is a realization of a random variable with possible values +c and −c, and with equal probability for both of them. Finally, after passing r rows of triangles, the particle falls into one of the r + 1 receptacles at the bottom. The probabilities of ending up in these receptacles, numbered 0, 1,{\ldots},r, follow a binomial law with parameters r and p = 0.5. When many particles have made their way through the obstacles, the height of the particles piled up in the several receptacles will be approximately proportional to the binomial probabilities. For a large number of rows, the probabilities approach a normal density function according to the central limit theorem. In its simplest form, this mathematical law states that the sum of many (r) independent, identically distributed random variables is, in the limit as r→∞, normally distributed. Therefore, a Galton board with many rows of obstacles shows normal density as the expected height of particle piles in the receptacles, and its mechanism captures the idea of a sum of r independent random variables. Figure 2b shows how Galton's construction was modified to describe the distribution of a product of such variables, which ultimately leads to a log-normal distribution. To this aim, scalene triangles are needed (although they appear to be isosceles in the figure), with the longer side to the right. Let the distance from the left edge of the board to the tip of the first obstacle below the funnel be xm. The lower corners of the first triangle are at xm {\textperiodcentered} c and xm/c (ignoring the gap necessary to allow the particles to pass between the obstacles). Therefore, the particle meets the tip of a triangle in the next row at X = xm {\textperiodcentered} c, or X = xm /c, with equal probabilities for both values. In the second and following rows, the triangles with the tip at distance x from the left edge have lower corners at x {\textperiodcentered} c and x/c (up to the gap width). Thus, the horizontal position of a particle is multiplied in each row by a random variable with equal probab},

abstract = {Life history theory suggests that selective predation on older or larger individuals in prey populations or a disturbance such as intense and episodic predation should lead to smaller size at maturity, and a tendency toward semelparity. Many populations of the intertidal amphipod, Corophium volutator, in the western Atlantic are subjected to an intense period of size-selective predation for about one month in summer, during the southward migration of shorebirds. We compared size at maturity and fecundity of populations of C. volutator from mudflats that are intensively used by shorebirds with populations that are visited by very few birds. We found that mature females were of similar size in May, but those from bird mudflats produced more offspring during the first reproductive episode. In July, females of the summer generation began to reproduce at a smaller size on bird mudflats, and as a consequence, produced fewer offspring that grew more slowly. The results of this correlative study suggest that shorebird predation has shaped C. volutator life history in two ways. First, females on bird mudflats concentrate their reproductive effort into a larger early brood, probably because later broods would come to maturity during the period of intense predation. Second, in summer, amphipods begin to reproduce at a smaller size so as to produce a brood before the arrival of the birds in mid-July. Predators are not present at the time that these responses occur, and thus they are probably not a plastic response to perceived predation risk. Thus the patterns we observed agree with the predictions of recent theories: individuals faced with a predictable disturbance alter their life cycles so as to minimize the effect of that disturbance.},

abstract = {This study investigates the aerodynamics of the falcon Falco peregrinus while diving. During a dive peregrines can reach velocities of more than 320 km h⁻¹. Unfortunately, in freely roaming falcons, these high velocities prohibit a precise determination of flight parameters such as velocity and acceleration as well as body shape and wing contour. Therefore, individual F. peregrinus were trained to dive in front of a vertical dam with a height of 60 m. The presence of a well-defined background allowed us to reconstruct the flight path and the body shape of the falcon during certain flight phases. Flight trajectories were obtained with a stereo high-speed camera system. In addition, body images of the falcon were taken from two perspectives with a high-resolution digital camera. The dam allowed us to match the high-resolution images obtained from the digital camera with the corresponding images taken with the high-speed cameras. Using these data we built a life-size model of F. peregrinus and used it to measure the drag and lift forces in a wind-tunnel. We compared these forces acting on the model with the data obtained from the 3-D flight path trajectory of the diving F. peregrinus. Visualizations of the flow in the wind-tunnel uncovered details of the flow structure around the falcon's body, which suggests local regions with separation of flow. High-resolution pictures of the diving peregrine indicate that feathers pop-up in the equivalent regions, where flow separation in the model falcon occurred.},

abstract = {A key assumption of many allopatric speciation models is that evolution in peripheral or isolated populations is facilitated by drastic reductions in population size. Population bottlenecks are believed to lead to rapid changes in gene frequencies through genetic drift, to facilitate rapid emergence of novel phenotypes, and to enhance reproductive isolation via genetic revolutions. For such effects to occur, founding populations must be very small, and remain small for some time after founding. This assumption has, however, rarely been tested in nature. One approach is to exploit the polymorphism of the major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) to obtain information about the founding population. Here, we use the Mhc polymorphism to estimate the size of the founding population of Darwin's finches in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Archipelago.

abstract = {Predation affects life history traits of nearly all organisms and the population consequences of predator avoidance are often larger than predation itself. Climate change has been shown to cause phenological changes. These changes are not necessarily similar between species and may cause mismatches between prey and predator. Eurasian sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus, the main predator of passerines, has advanced its autumn phenology by about ten days in 30 years due to climate change. However, we do not know if sparrowhawk migrate earlier in response to earlier migration by its prey or if earlier sparrowhawk migration results in changes to predation risk on its prey. By using the median departure date of 41 passerine species I was able to show that early migrating passerines tend to advance, and late migrating species delay their departure, but none of the species have advanced their departure times as much as the sparrowhawk. This has lead to a situation of increased predation risk on early migrating long-distance migrants (LDM) and decreased the overlap of migration season with later departing short-distance migrants (SDM). Findings highlight the growing list of problems of declining LDM populations caused by climate change. On the other hand it seems that the autumn migration may become safer for SDM whose populations are growing. Results demonstrate that passerines show very conservative response in autumn phenology to climate change, and thus phenological mismatches caused by global warming are not necessarily increasing towards the higher trophic levels.},

abstract = {When populations grow or decline, habitat selection may change due to local density-dependent processes, such as site dependence and interference. In seasonally migrating animals, nonbreeding distributions may be determined through these mechanisms of density dependence, which we examine here at a hemispheric scale for a long-distance migrating bird. Using summer and winter resightings of 2,095 Eurasian spoonbills Platalea leucorodia leucorodia that were ringed in the Netherlands during 16 years of fast population growth, we show that neither site dependence nor interference fully explains their patterns of survival and winter distribution. Within their three main wintering areas, annual survival decreased with an increase in population size. While survival was consistently higher in the two European wintering areas (France, Iberia), most spoonbills migrated onward to winter in west Africa. The number of birds wintering in Europe increased, but not enough to maximize annual survival. We conclude that a constraint of tradition (their "migration tendency") inhibits birds from changing their migratory habits. We pose that this phenomenon may similarly constrain other migratory populations from rapidly responding to large-scale climate- and/or human-driven habitat changes at their wintering grounds.},

abstract = {Recent models have worked with the assumption that birds try to minimize either time, energy or predation risk during migration, or some combination of these. The few empirical studies available have suggested that time minimization may be the most common strategy. One way of distinguishing between strategies is to study the departure decisions of migrating birds. We supplied migrating European robins, Erithacus rubecula, with food ad libitum in the field and monitored their changes in body mass prior to departure. The overall mass gain rate (ktot, the ratio of daily mass increase to lean mass) of 10 birds using the feeding station was on average 0.05 (range 0.03–0.09). Departure fuel loads (fdep, the ratio of fuel mass to lean mass) were on average 0.53 (range 0.35–0.66). There was no significant correlation between fdep and ktot, which indicates a strategy of minimizing the energy cost of transport, rather than minimizing time but other aspects of the fuel deposition pattern suggest that time minimization may also be important. Whereas the behaviour of the robins was difficult to interpret in the light of optimal migration strategies, the importance of weather was striking. The robins selected the best weather conditions (tail wind, high air pressure and no precipitation) within the likely period of departure.},

abstract = {Under the ideal-free distribution, omniscient individuals with similar habitat requirements that are free to move should be distributed such that no individual can improve fitness by changing sites; deviations would indicate trade-offs and constraints on ranging behavior. We studied site occupancy and annual survival in red knots Calidris c. canutus at their main wintering area Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania. We collected mark-resighting data at 2 high-tide roosts (A and B) that were only 3 km apart and within sight. Birds were faithful to their roosts and foraged in nearby intertidal areas, with no overlap between birds from A and B. Shellfish-rich seagrass beds were of greater abundance for birds roosting at A than at B. During 8 winters, we found different sex ratios (48{\%} and 58{\%} males at A and B, respectively) and different proportion of juveniles (22{\%} and 45{\%}) at the 2 roosts. Adult annual survival was higher at A (0.83 ± 0.01 standard error [SE]) than at B (0.81 ± 0.03). Though rare, between winter season movements were 3 times more frequent from B to A than vice versa, indicating that knots can assess the differences in site quality: birds behaved as if they were “ideal”. As larger females and older birds occurred more at A, differences in competi- tive ability might maintain the site occupancy pattern. As females return from the high Arctic breeding grounds first, and adults return before juveniles, priority of occupancy may also play a role. Such an advantage of arriving earlier would represent a seasonal carryover effect. Key words: Calidris canutus canutus, capture–recapture models, carryover effect, high-tide roost, ideal preemptive distribution, multi-state models, seagrass, sex ratio, site fidelity, survival.},

abstract = {Large parts of the south-western Atlantic soft bottom intertidals are inhabited by the burrowing crab Neohelice granulata (previously known as Chasmagnathus granulatus) and the mud crab Cyrtograpsus angulatus, but adults rarely coexist in the same microhabitat. We describe the influence of burrows of N. granulata on the recruitment dynamic of C. angulatus and the effects of different ontogenetic stages of N. granulata on survival of recruits of C. angulatus. A two summer sampling shows that N. granulata burrows facilitate settlement of both species. To evaluate the mortality of recruits inside burrows, we performed afield experiment with juvenile and adult crab exclusion cages and inclusion of juveniles or adults of N. granulata. The results showed differences in crab sizes between treatments, due to predatory interactions that depended on prey size. When only juveniles of N. granulata were present, the higher mortality of C. angulatus was observed in smaller crabs. However when adults of N. granulata were present, larger juvenile crabs are the ones that suffered the highest mortality. These results show that adults are preying upon larger juveniles (of both species) reducing the mortality of the smaller ones that are preyed by the larger ones. We also measured emigration from these burrowing assemblages using bidirectional pitfall traps which showed that C. angulatus juveniles are leaving the burrows towards the subtidal. Here we demonstrate that N. granulata have positive and negative effects on the settlement of C. angulatus. These results highlight the importance of including stage-dependence relationships to analyse species interaction in marine ecology field works.},

Our second most important site was the Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor complex of wetlands in Washington. The mean length of stay past banding sites ranged from 1.0 to 3.8 days. Controlling for date of departure, birds banded at San Francisco Bay had higher rates of travel to the Copper River Delta than those banded at Grays Harbor. The later a bird left a capture site, the faster it traveled to the Copper River Delta. Length of stay at the Copper River Delta was inversely related to arrival date. We did not find any effect of sex on travel rate or length of stay.

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine factors affecting habitat use by Semipalmated Sandpipers, Calidris pusilla, during their critical migration stopover in the upper Bay of Fundy. Using radio-telemetry, individual sandpipers were found to be highly mobile, often moving several kilometers daily between roosting and foraging sites. No direct relationship was found between the number of times a sandpiper was detected on a foraging site and the amount of their main prey, Corophium volutator, on that site. Using Akaike's Information Criterion model selection, the density of sandpipers foraging on mudflats around the Bay was best predicted using a single factor – density of C. volutator in August. This shows that sandpipers in the Bay of Fundy most often select foraging sites with high prey abundance, but will occasionally forage on sites with low prey abundance. The study points to the importance of protecting and conserving the Fundy mudflats. iii Acknowledgements},

abstract = {1. Migration is a common strategy used by birds that breed in seasonal environments, and multiple environmental and biological factors determine the timing of migration. How these factors operate in combination during autumn migration, which is considered to be under weaker time constraints relative to spring migration, is not clear. 2. Here, we examine the patterns and determinants of migration timing for nocturnal migrants during autumn migration in the north-eastern USA using nocturnal reflectivity data from 12 weather surveillance radar stations and modelled diurnal probability of occurrence for 142 species of nocturnal migrants. We first model the capacity of seasonal atmospheric conditions (wind and precipitation) and ecological productivity (vegetation greenness) to pre- dict autumn migration intensity. We then test predictions, formulated under optimal migra- tion theory, on how migration timing should be related to assemblage-level estimates of body size and total migration distance within the context of dietary guild (insectivore and omni- vore) and level of dietary plasticity during autumn migration. 3. Our results indicate seasonal declines in ecological productivity delineate the beginning and end of peak migration, whose intensity is best predicted by the velocity of winds at migration altitudes. Insectivorous migrants departed earlier in the season and, consistent with our predictions, large-bodied and long-distance insectivorous migrants departed the earliest. Contrary to our predictions, large-bodied and some long-distance omnivorous migrants departed later in the season, patterns that were replicated in part by insectivorous migrants that displayed dietary plasticity during autumn migration. 4. Our findings indicate migration timing in the region is dictated by optimality strategies, modified based on the breadth and flexibility of migrant's foraging diets, with declining eco- logical productivity defining possible resource thresholds during which migration occurs when winds at migration altitudes are mild. These observations provide the basis to assess how avian migration strategies may be affected by adjustments in seasonal patterns of atmospheric circulation and ecological productivity that may occur under global climate change.},

Numbers of breeding Caspian Terns declined 36{\%} from 2003 to 2009, mostly due to abandonment of the Knight Island colony and decline of the Brooks Island colony, the two largest colonies in the SFBA. Concurrently, nesting success declined 69{\%} associated with colony site characteristics such as (a) quality and quantity of nesting substrate, (b) vulnerability to nest predators, (c) displacement by other colonial waterbirds and (d) human disturbance. Marine fishes were the predominant prey in tern diets from the SFBA; however, diet composition varied among colonies. Juvenile salmonids comprised 22.9{\%} of the diet of terns nesting in the North Bay, 5.3{\%} of diet of terns nesting in the Central Bay, and 0.1{\%} in the South Bay. Construction or restoration of nesting islands in the South Bay may help maintain and restore breeding Caspian Terns without enhancing mortality of salmonid stocks of conservation concern.

abstract = {R is rapidly growing in popularity as the environment of choice for data analysis and graphics both in academia and industry. Lattice brings the proven design of Trellis graphics (originally developed for S by William S. Cleveland and colleagues at Bell Labs) to R, considerably expanding its capabilities in the process. Lattice is a powerful and elegant high level data visualization system that is sufficient for most everyday graphics needs, yet flexible enough to be easily extended to handle demands of cutting edge research. Written by the author of the lattice system, this book describes it in considerable depth, beginning with the essentials and systematically delving into specific low levels details as necessary. No prior experience with lattice is required to read the book, although basic familiarity with R is assumed. The book contains close to 150 figures produced with lattice. Many of the examples emphasize principles of good graphical design; almost all use real data sets that are publicly available in various R packages. All code and figures in the book are also available online, along with supplementary material covering more advanced topics.},

abstract = {Range expansions of species due to climate change threaten the function and composition of marine ecosystems globally, yet factors constraining or facilitating this redistribution are poorly understood. Native predators may constrain prey shifting poleward through consumption, or by restricting their feeding activity. However, the extent that native predators impact range-expanders will likely be structured by physiological mismatches between these groups, associated with water temperatures. We examined how temperate predators and seasonal water temperature affected foraging of the planktivorous tropical reef fish, Abudefduf vaigiensis, within temperate southeastern Australian waters, an emerging new range. Foraging excursions of A. vaigiensis were compared between predator-rich marine reserves and predator-depauperate fished reefs during summer and winter ({\~{}}18 and 22 °C water, respectively). A. vaigiensis foraged with shorter excursions in marine reserves than fished reefs and higher excursions during summer than winter. Effects of predation risk and water temperature on A. vaigiensis foraging were isolated in an aquarium experiment. Groups were held at 18 or 22 °C and visually exposed to a temperate predator, a predator control (temperate herbivore) and an empty tank. Foraging excursions and feeding rates were reduced when exposed to predators at 22 °C, but did not differ between predator and the predator control or empty tank at 18 °C. Results suggest temperate predators may restrict range expansions of A. vaigiensis by reducing its' food intake during summer months. But winter water temperatures may limit feeding, independent of predation risk. Protection of predators from fishing should improve resistance of some marine ecosystems to impacts of range expanding prey.},

abstract = {Plasma metabolites provide information about the physiological state and fuel use of birds, and have been used for predicting refueling rates of birds during migratory stopovers. However, little is known about the effect of diet on metabolite concentrations in small songbirds. We investigated the effect of dietary macronutrient composition on lipid and protein metabolites in captive White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis). Birds fed a high-protein, low-carbohydrate insect diet had lower plasma triglyceride concentrations and higher plasma B-hydroxybutyrate concentrations than birds fed a high-carbohydrate, low-protein grain diet during feeding. The insect-fed birds also had higher plasma uric acid concentrations than grain-fed birds and birds fed a low-protein, high-fat, and high-carbohydrate fruit diet. Diet did not significantly influence plasma concentrations of glycerol or nonesterified fatty acids. After subsequent overnight fasting, birds in all three diet groups had similar concentrations of lipid metabolites, but uric acid was marginally elevated in insect-fed birds. Given that dietary macronutrient composition affected certain plasma metabolite concentrations in sparrows, investigators should consider such diet effects when using these metabolites to estimate refueling rates of free-living migratory songbirds, particularly in species that exhibit dietary plasticity during migration. {\textcopyright} The Cooper Ornithological Society 2007.},

abstract = {Models of population dynamics that include interference competition have often been applied to foraging waders and less so to other foragers, even though these models are, in principle, generally applicable. At present, however, it is still unclear whether interference competition is of importance for foraging waders. To support this idea experimental evidence and knowledge of the mechanisms underlying interference effects are required. We experimentally determined the relationship between forager density and foraging success in two wader species: the red knot (Calidris canutus) and the ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres). With each of the two species, we conducted an experiment consisting of 300 one-min trials. In these trials we scored the behavior and the foraging success of focal individuals at specific combinations of bird and prey density. Irrespective of prey density, individuals of both species discovered fewer prey items at higher bird densities. Despite this, only in turnstones did intake rates decline with increasing bird density. Knots compensated for a lower prey-discovery rate by rejecting fewer prey items at higher bird densities. In knots, bird density had a complex, nonmonotonic effect on the time spent vigilant and searching. In turnstones the main effect of increased bird density was a reduction in the prey-encounter rate, that is, the reward per unit search time. Effects on the time spent vigilant and the time spent searching were less pronounced than in knots. Thus, the mechanistic basis of the effects of bird density was complex for each of the two species and differed between them.},

abstract = {Spring migration of birds in many parts of the world has advanced as the climate has become warmer. Variation in advancement among species has been proposed to correlate with geography and life history features, but individual studies have reported variable results, and general patterns have been elusive. In a quantitative review of data from 389 bird species sampled at 69 European and 23 North American localities, we evaluated associations between change in the timing of migration and life history (body size, molt, broodedness), ecology (habitat, diet, nest position), and geography. We confirmed that spring migration advanced: -0.214 d yr(-1) (95{\%} CI: -0.266, -0.162) for first-arriving individuals and -0.104 d yr(-1) (-0.139, -0.071) for the median date of passage. The rate of change in autumn was more variable: 0.090 d yr(-1) (0.002, 0.176) delay for median passage and 0.019 d yr(-1) (-0.175, 0.204) delay for the date of last departure. The response during spring was weaker in the far north and in species that migrate long distances to the wintering area. Autumn migration became increasingly delayed in species that are large-bodied, molt before departure, and that feed on seeds, insects, or fruits. Variation among species, especially during autumn, was associated in part with constraints surrounding the timing of the postnuptial molt. The results suggest that ecological and life history features of species may influence their ability to respond to climate change.},

Much less is known about effects on autumn migration, especially for birds of prey. I studied simultaneous changes in spring and autumn phenology using data from 14 raptor species at two bird observatories on the shore of Lake Superior, North America. Median migration date advanced by 0.13 days{\textperiodcentered}year-1 in spring and was delayed by 0.23 days{\textperiodcentered}year-1 in autumn, with significant heterogeneity among species. Long-distance migrants were observed late in spring and early in autumn and showed less phenological change during autumn than short-distance migrants. The migratory period has become more extended, especially for short-distance migrants. Opposite responses during the two seasons had the effect of extending time spent to the north of the study area, by up to 30 days in some species since the early 1970s. These phenological shifts—potentially related to climate change— are causing dramatic changes in the annual cycle of North American raptors; whether these are beneficial or detrimental is unknown.},

abstract = {Estuarine mudflats, among the most important foraging grounds for waders during the non-breeding season, consist of complex mosaics of shallow pools and dry areas during low tide. In this study, we carried out close-range focal observations to determine foraging parameters of dunlins Calidris alpina, foraging in the mudflat microhabitats of the Tagus estuary, Portugal. Birds foraging in wet patches mostly targeted the siphons of the bivalve Scrobicularia plana, while in dry patches they mostly fed on mudsnails Hydrobia ulvae. Surface visibility of prey, rather than their abundance in the sediment, explained the microhabitat-related differences in prey selection. Birds using dry patches obtained 40{\%} less energy intake than those using wet patches, still many extensively used this poor microhabitat. Because siphons retract quickly when the sediment is disturbed, birds often failed to catch them. We found that birds that were less efficient in capturing siphons in wet patches tended to spend more time foraging on mudsnails in dry patches. This suggests that lack of skills in siphon cropping represents a major foraging constraint for dunlins wintering in the Tagus estuary. It may even cause them to forage during high tide in order to achieve their daily energetic requirements.},

abstract = {Macrozoobenthic communities of intertidal soft sediments are reviewed worldwide from the perspective of a mollusc-eating shorebird species. Based on 19 sites, total biomass figures varied between 5 and 80 g AFDM per m2(average 24 g AFDM per m2); no latitudinal trends are apparent. The contribution made by bivalves and gastropods varies between 1{\%} and 99{\%}, north-temperate intertidal flats having relatively more molluscs than tropical flats. Intertidal flats in the tropics contain a greater variety of taxa, with brachiopods in Indonesia and echinoderms in northwest Australia contributing significantly to biomass only there. Limits to the occurrence of avian predators of intertidal benthos are set by the harvestable fraction of the biomass on offer and the costs of living at a particular site. No systematic differences in the harvestable fraction of the total mollusc-biomass for a worldwide occurring shorebird species specializing on molluscs (knots Calidris canutus) were apparent between temperate and tropical intertidal areas, in spite of large differences in maintenance metabolism incurred by these birds. The harvestable fractions of bivalves in the two West African areas (Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau) tended to be high (23-84{\%} of total biomass in six species), they were relatively low (2-52{\%} in five species) in the temperate Wadden Sea and the tropical northwest Australian site. Harvestable biomass determines the intake rate of shorebirds, as illustrated by functional-response curves of knots feeding on two bivalves species. We argue that the collection of information on size-depth relationships along with faunal and biomass surveys at a range of sites is bound to greatly increase our understanding of both the biology of tidal-flat invertebrates and the resource base under-pinning the spectacular seasonal migrations of shorebirds.},

Twelve abundance estimates for each plot were obtained each year. We used analysis of covariance to model the results, controlling for the presence of roosting gulls that may have displaced foraging shorebirds. The analysis included effects related to intraseasonal timing, annual variation, and the presence of aquaculture. The two most abundant shorebird species in Tomales Bay, western sandpiper, Calidris maurl, and dunlin, Calidris alpina, significantly avoided aquaculture areas. Willets, Catoptrophoros semipalmatus, however, were attracted to aquaculture plots. Four other species showed no preferences for control or aquaculture plots. Evidence of underlying (pre-existing) habitat conditions did not explain these results. We found no differences in species richness or Shannon diversity index between control and aquaculture areas. Our results suggest a net decrease in total shorebird use in areas developed for aquaculture.},

abstract = {Long-jump migrant shorebirds have brief windows during spring stopover to acquire the energy needed to complete migration. Red Knots (Calidris canutus) refueling on Horseshoe Crab (Limulus polyphemus) eggs in Delaware Bay can meet their energy needs foraging only by day. In nearby Virginia, thousands of Red Knots stop over, but primarily low-quality, hard-shelled prey are available. One tactic Red Knots may use to meet their energy demands with such prey might be to extend their foraging time by feeding at night. To estimate the length of the foraging day in Virginia, daylight feeding was studied during three spring stopover periods (2008 to 2010), and night feeding was studied in 2010. Red Knots foraged 76 ± 3 SE{\%} of the time in 2008 and 2009 combined, and 59 ± 3{\%} of the time in 2010, during 3-minute observations. In 2010, Red Knots foraged 51 ± 7{\%} of the time during a continuous 7-h daytime observation and 77 ± 5{\%} of the time during a continuous 8-h night time observation on the same island. Given constraints on energy intake, night foraging by Red Knots in Virginia may be necessary for birds to attain sufficient mass to complete migration.},

abstract = {Foundation species can provide habitat that modify abiotic and biotic processes that contribute to ecosystem function. While many studies have focused on the processes and consequences of a focal foundation species, understanding the ecological equivalence of co-occurring foundation species is important to identify key species responsible for ecosystem function. Here, we investigated the relative contributions of co-occurring foundation species on abiotic (temperature) and biotic responses of invertebrate species (recruitment, persistence, growth and survival). In a series of experimental field studies, we manipulated foundation species to measure invertebrate recruitment, persistence, and predation. A laboratory experiment measured foundation species effects on herbivore growth. Results demonstrated that macroalgal (Fucus vesiculosus ecad and Ascophyllum nodosum ecad scorpioides) intermediate foundation species provide habitat, food, and alleviate abiotic stress for dominant littorinid herbivores that surpass that provided by the primary species (Spartina alterniflora). These foundation effects were species-specific with F. vesiculosus ecad important for early life-history stages (enhanced recruitment and early growth of littorinid snails) and A. nodosum ecad important later on as a refuge from predators (Carcinus meanas) and stressful temperature. Understanding of the different effects of co-occurring foundation species on population and community processes is necessary for predicting community response to natural disturbance, species invasion, and ecosystem-based management actions.},

abstract = {The degree to which extrinsic factors influence migration chronology in North American waterfowl has not been quantified, particularly for dabbling ducks. Previous studies have examined waterfowl migration using various methods, however, quantitative approaches to define avian migration chronology over broad spatio-temporal scales are limited, and the implications for using different approaches have not been assessed. We used movement data from 19 female adult mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) equipped with solar-powered global positioning system satellite transmitters to evaluate two individual level approaches for quantifying migration chronology. The first approach defined migration based on individual movements among geopolitical boundaries (state, provincial, international), whereas the second method modeled net displacement as a function of time using nonlinear models. Differences in migration chronologies identified by each of the approaches were examined with analysis of variance. The geopolitical method identified mean autumn migration midpoints at 15 November 2010 and 13 November 2011, whereas the net displacement method identified midpoints at 15 November 2010 and 14 November 2011. The mean midpoints for spring migration were 3 April 2011 and 20 March 2012 using the geopolitical method and 31 March 2011 and 22 March 2012 using the net displacement method. The duration, initiation date, midpoint, and termination date for both autumn and spring migration did not differ between the two individual level approaches. Although we did not detect differences in migration parameters between the different approaches, the net displacement metric offers broad potential to address questions in movement ecology for migrating species. Ultimately, an objective definition of migration chronology will allow researchers to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the extrinsic factors that drive migration at the individual and population levels. As a result, targeted conservation plans can be developed to support planning for habitat management and evaluation of long-term climate effects.},

One female flew at least 79 km on one flight and, during another flight, the same bird flew over 19 km in 10 min, averaging 115 km/hr.

abstract = {Two portions of Kachemak Bay, Mud Bay and Mariner Park on the Homer Spit and the Fox River Flats, Alaska, are recognized collectively as a site of International Importance for shorebirds within the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHRSN). These sites were designated based on observations collected between the 1970s and 1990s that indicated more than 100,000 shorebirds stopped at the sites each spring during their northbound migration. As part of an effort to assess shorebird use of this area, the Kachemak Bay Birders (KBB), a volunteer citizen-science organization, conducted ground surveys along Homer Spit and nearby waters between 2009 and 2011. They also conducted a series of aerial surveys along the Kachemak Bay coastline in 2010. After restricting data to areas and time periods comparable to historic data, we found the average number of birds observed from the ground on the Homer Spit was down by one-third compared to previous counts (18,436 prior to 1995 versus 7,055 observed between 2009 and 2011). Most of this change was due to a drop in the number of Western Sandpipers Calidris mauri, the most numerous shorebird species observed. Numbers of other species fluctuated from year to year but not as much, and the overall species composition remained the same although several new species were observed in low numbers. Contemporary aerial surveys indicated a large qualitative decline in the number of birds on the Fox River Flats relative to aerial surveys conducted during the 1970s-1990s. We discuss the possibilities that these changes represent a temporary decline, a decrease in the use of the area, a reduction in population size of the more common species, or just an artifact of changing methodologies. We also discuss issues to consider when reassessing a WHSRN (or other) designation should contemporary surveys show its declining importance to birds. Finally, we advocate for a broader-based survey within Cook Inlet and along the Pacific Flyway to better understand the trends observed at Kachemak Bay.},

abstract = {The suggested link between lemming cycles and reproductive success of arctic birds is caused by potential effects of varying predation pressure (the Alternative Prey Hypothesis, APH) and protective association with birds of prey (the Nesting Associ- ation Hypothesis, NAH). We used data collected over two complete lemming cycles to investigate how fluctuations in lemming density were associated with nesting success of greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens atlanticus) in the Canadian High Arctic. We tested predictions of the APH and NAH for geese breeding at low and high densities. Goose nesting success varied from 22{\%} to 91{\%} between years and the main egg predator was the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus). Nesting associations with snowy owls (Nyctea scandiaca) were observed but only during peak lemming years for geese nesting at low density. Goose nesting success declined as distance from owls increased and reached a plateau at 550 m. Artificial nest experiments indicated that owls can exclude predators from the vicinity of their nests and thus reduce goose egg predation rate. Annual nest failure rate was negatively associated with rodent abundance and was generally highest in low lemming years. This relationship was present even after excluding goose nests under the protective influence of owls. However, nest failure was inversely density-dependent at high breeding density. Thus, annual variations in nest density influenced the synchrony between lemming cycles and oscillations in nesting success. Our results suggest that APH is the main mechanism linking lemming cycles and goose nesting success and that nesting associations during peak lemming years (NAH) can enhance this positive link at the local level. The study also shows that breeding strategies used by birds (the alterna- tive prey) could affect the synchrony between oscillations in avian reproductive success and rodent cycles.},

abstract = {Size assortative mating has received increasing attention due to its potential to drive divergence and perhaps speciation. In this study, we examined assortative pairing at 17 nests of Darwin's Small Tree Finches, Camarhynchus parvulus. We found positive assortative pairing for two traits: bill length and tarsus length, and these traits showed a significant positive correlation to each other. Assortative pairing could be driven by female choice for similar phenotypes because male-male competition has rarely been observed in the Small Tree Finch, nor have males been observed to reject potential mates. Given the high heritability of bill morphology in Darwin's finches, it is possible that female preference for male bill length, a trait that is known to be important for foraging, will influence offspring bill size to maximise efficient exploitation of resources. The finding of size assortative pairing on the basis of tarsus length requires more research, but suggests different trait utilities for different foraging niches. Interestingly, the highland distribution of tarsus length across the population showed a unimodal distribution, but a bimodal distribution after pairing. While not significant, we found comparatively large differences across study plots in tarsus length, which suggests the possibility of phenotype-habitat matching at a small spatial scale in this species. Our findings are significant in the context of the adaptive radiation of Darwin's finches as they are consistent with the allopatric model of speciation but also show potential for adaptive divergence in sympatry in Darwin's tree finches. {\textcopyright} Dt.

Next, they address the problems of theory and conceptual framework for individual-based ecology: What is "theory"? That is, how do we develop reusable models of how system dynamics arise from characteristics of individuals? What conceptual framework do we use when the classical differential equation framework no longer applies? An extensive review illustrates the ecological problems that have been addressed with individual-based models. The authors then identify how the mechanics of building and using individual-based models differ from those of traditional science, and provide guidance on formulating, programming, and analyzing models. This book will be helpful to ecologists interested in modeling, and to other scientists interested in agent-based modeling.},

abstract = {Mammals are threatened with population decline and extinction. Numerous species require immediate conservation intervention. But our ability to identify species on the brink of decline, and to intervene successfully, depends on developing reliable leading indicators of population, community, and environmental change. Classic approaches, such as population and life history assessment, as well as indicator species, trail environmental change. Adaptive behaviors honed by natural selection to respond quickly to environmental changes represent true leading indicators that we can learn to apply to conservation and management. Excellent examples of useful behaviors for conservation include foraging behavior, patch use, and habitat selection. Comparisons among giving-up densities collected in artificial resource patches can effectively indicate the forager's predation costs, its habitat quality, mechanisms of coexistence, and environmental richness. Patterns of adaptive habitat use can similarly reveal the relative value of different types of habitat, the location, and amounts of source versus sink habitat in a landscape, the effects of human disturbance, and projections on future extinction risk. Each behavior is likely to change more quickly than population size. As useful as these and related indicators may be to managers and conservationists, similar behaviors can emerge from different causes, and immediate returns of behavior to fitness may cause rapid evolution of associated morphological and physiological traits. Conservation strategies will thereby often be most effective if they build on research programs targeting the processes influencing adaptive behaviors and that assess whether wild-type or novel behaviors are most likely to sustain populations into the future.},

abstract = {Human-mediated environmental changes have resulted in appropriate concern for the conservation of ecological systems and have led to the development of many ecological monitoring programs worldwide. Many programs that are identified with the purpose of 'surveillance' represent an inefficient use of conservation funds and effort. Here, we revisit the 1964 paper by Platt and argue that his recommendations about the conduct of science are equally relevant to the conduct of ecological monitoring programs. In particular, we argue that monitoring should not be viewed as a stand-alone activity, but instead as a component of a larger process of either conservation-oriented science or management. Corresponding changes in monitoring focus and design would lead to substantial increases in the efficiency and usefulness of monitoring results in conservation. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Wilson2013,
abstract = {Marine waterbirds have shown variable trends in abundance over the past four decades with some species displaying steep declines along the Pacific coast from British Columbia through California. One of the most dramatic changes has been that of western grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis) in the Salish Sea. This region was a former core of the species wintering distribution but they have become increasingly rare prompting calls for conservation action. A more thorough understanding of this situation requires the analysis of trends at broader geographic scales as well as a consideration of mechanisms that might have led to a change in abundance. We used hierarchical modeling with a Bayesian framework applied to 36 years of Audubon Christmas Bird Count data to assess continent-wide and regional population trends in western and Clark's grebes (A. clarkii) from 1975 to 2010. Our results show that the North American wintering population of Aechmophorus grebes decreased by ∼52{\%} after 1975, but also that western grebes displayed strongly opposing regional patterns. Abundance decreased by about 95{\%} over 36 years in the Salish Sea but increased by over 300{\%} along coastal California. As a result, the mean centre of the species distribution shifted south by an estimated 895 km between 1980 and 2010. Mechanisms underlying this shift require further study but we hypothesize that it may be related to a change in the abundance and availability of their forage fish prey base. Since the mid-1980s, the Pacific sardine stock off the California coast increased from a few thousand metric tonnes to over two million. At the same time both the abundance and availability of Pacific herring declined in the Salish Sea. Studies are needed to examine this hypothesis further and additional consideration should be directed at other changes in the marine environment that may have contributed to a range shift.},

abstract = {The intertidal mudflats at Porter Point in the Minas Basin, Bay of Fundy, are dominated by deposit-feeding organisms: the polychaetes Tharyx acutus, Heteromastus filiformis, and Scoloplos fragilis and a podocopid ostracod. The site is unusual in that the amphipod Corophium volutator is absent. In flats where the above polychaetes and Corophium co-occur, fish and shorebird predators significantly affect Corophium abundance but not polychaete abundance. Experiments were performed at Porter Point to determine whether fish and shorebirds depress polychaete abundance in the absence of their preferred prey. Caging experiments, with cages erected in late May 1985 and sampled in early July and in late August, revealed that Tharyx abundance was significantly higher within cages, demonstrating a significant effect of epibenthic predators. No other species showed significant differences in abundance between caged and control areas. Experiments demonstrate that fish prey on Tharyx but shorebirds do not. No species showed significant differences in abundance between caged and control areas in October collections. Winter ice, present between mid-December and mid-March, did not lead to a decline in the abundance of any taxon. Heteromastus abundance actually increased, possibly by rafting of sediment from other parts of the flat on blocks of ice.},

abstract = {Prey are often at risk from multiple predator species with differing hunting modes, but the resulting response to the spatial variation in predation risk (the landscape of fear) has rarely been considered in predator prey models. We tested whether attack frequency and hunting success along a habitat gradient (distance from an estuarine shoreline) differed between 2 predators hunting a single prey species, so affecting the optimal antipredation position along this gradient. Sparrowhawks ambushed redshanks most frequently from the predator-concealing cover of the shoreline, and their capture success rate was twice as high as when hunting far from the shoreline ({\textgreater} 50 m). In contrast, pursuit-hunting peregrines attacked redshanks most frequently far from the shoreline, though their capture success rate was unaffected by distance. Thus, the relative occurrence and success of both predators varied so that avoidance of one predator led to increased predation risk from the other, generating 2 broad conclusions. First, the equilibrium distribution of prey in the presence of multiple predators is likely to reflect the attack frequency and attack success rate of both predators combined across relevant environmental gradients. Second, predation-risk avoidance gradients may be less steep, or less tightly linked to any single habitat feature, than might be predicted if a single predator is considered.},

abstract = {Quantitative study of live and total foraminiferal faunas in samples from six transects through marsh environments at Kaipara Harbour, Miranda, and Pauatahanui Inlet, New Zealand (two transects each), show the presence of a distinctive high tidal species association that has potential for the recognition of former sea-level heights from late Quaternary deposits. Seven species associations are recognised by R-mode cluster analysis of total (live plus dead) foraminiferal faunal data. Mangrove forest and salt meadow below MHWS (mean high water spring level), in near normal salinity marshes (Kaipara, Miranda), are dominated by an Ammonia association with subsidiary Elphidium excavatum, Haplophragmoides- Miliamminafusca, and Helenina associations. In less saline marshes (Pauatahanui), the salt meadow and rush marsh below MHWS, are dominated by a Haplophragmoides- Miliamminafusca association. In all transects, the narrow zone between MHWS and EHWS (extreme high water spring level) is dominated ({\textgreater}90{\%} relative abundance) by a Trochammina association (7! inflata, T. macrescens, Miliammina obliqua). A palimpsest, Ammonia-dominated, exposed beach fauna on the penultimate chenier interferes with the recognition of this high tidal Trochammina zone in one Miranda transect. Dependent upon their proximity to exposed sea conditions and fast-flowing tidal channels, there are variable numbers of introduced foraminiferal tests (Cornuspira association) in the marshes at all levels. At Pauatahanui, a monospecific fauna of T. macrescens is present just at EHWS (upper 0.1 m of tidal range). This has been recognised previously only in northeast America and may provide the most accurate paleo-sea level marker known. There appear to be no significant tide-related trends in diversity, but in all transects there is a marked abundance peak between MHWS and EHWS levels, which if recognised in fossil faunas could also be useful in determining previous sea-level heights.},

abstract = {Plant and animal species have been used for decades as indicators of air and water quality and agricultural and range conditions. Increasingly, vertebrates are used to assess population trends and habitat quality for other species. In this paper we review the conceptual bases, assumptions, and published guidelines for selection and use of vertebrates as ecological indicators. We conclude that an absence of precise definitions and procedures, confounded criteria used to select species, and discordance with ecological literature severely weaken the effectiveness and credibility of using vertebrates as ecological indicators. In many cases the use of ecological indicator species is inappropriate, but when necessary, the following recommendations will make their use more rigorous: (1) clearly state assessment goals, (2) use indicators only when other assessment options are unavailable, (3) choose indicator species by explicitly defined criteria that are in accord with assessment goals, (4) include all species that fulfill stated selection criteria (5) know the biology of the indicator in detail, and treat the indicator as a formal estimator in conceptual and statistical models, (6) identify and define sources of subjectivity when selecting monitoring and intetpreting indicator species, (7) submit assessment design, methods of data collection and statistical analysis, interpretations, and recommendations to peer review and (8) direct research at developing an overall strategy for monitoring wildlife that accounts for natural variability in population attributes and incorporates concepts from landscape ecology.},

abstract = {Measures of animal behavior can be used in a variety of situations to make inferences about the environment and population status. Work by our research group shows that migratory shorebirds adjust their usage of, and behavior at, stopover sites in response to environmental conditions. Motivated by this, we built an individual-based model of migrating shorebirds moving through a sequence of alternating small and large stopover sites. Birds at larger sites are safer from predators, but we assumed that less food is available than at small sites. In the model, both predation risk and food intake are density-dependent, and the behavior of migrants is controlled by two rules: one that determines whether a bird will depart a stopover site, and one that controls the individual's foraging versus vigilance intensity. The optimal behavior is calculated by maximizing a payoff function that depends on arrival date and arrival energy stores at the final site. We used this model to predict mass gain, foraging intensity, and usage by migrants of small and large sites under various conditions. We examined the effects of a flyway-wide reduction in the amount of food, a flyway-wide increase in predation danger, and the effects of lowering the overall population size. The mass action of many individuals, each optimizing its migration timing and routing, leads to the emergence of distinctive patterns of behavior and site choice under these differing environmental conditions. When food availability is reduced throughout the flyway, Our model predicts that foraging intensity increases at every stopover site, thereby forcing birds to accept greater danger to maintain the fitness benefit of a timely arrival to the breeding area. A flyway-wide increase in predation danger results in fewer migrants choosing (and/or migrants staying a shorter time at) small stopover sites, balanced by a higher usage of large sites. These effects contrast with what is observed under true population declines, when the usage of both small and large sites declines.},

Beds of washed up wracks and kelp sire used as a feeding habitat where they take kelp fly larvae (Coelopidae) at a high rate (17.8 larvae min(-1)). This high energy intake allows rapid fattening (1.7-3.3 g day(-1)) and short lengths of stay (about 4-5 days), leading to a high daily turnover of individuals (0.2-0.7 day(-1)). Despite the good conditions for meeting energetic requirements, staging at the island incurred a high depredation risk from migrating birds of prey. Different feeding priorities might be one reason why most adult Dunlins avoid Helgoland as a staging site and instead aggregate at large staging areas such as the Wadden Sea, where individual depreciation risk is more than 50 times less.},

abstract = {Few species are likely to be so evident that they will always be detected when present. Failing to allow for the possibility that a target species was present, but undetected, at a site will lead to biased estimates of site occupancy, colonization, and local extinction probabilities. These population vital rates are often of interest in long-term monitoring programs and metapopulation studies. We present a model that enables direct estimation of these parameters when the probability of detecting the species is less than 1. The model does not require any assumptions of process stationarity, as do some previous methods, but does require detection/nondetection data to be collected in a manner similar to Pollock's robust design as used in mark–recapture studies. Via simulation, we show that the model provides good estimates of parameters for most scenarios considered. We illustrate the method with data from monitoring programs of Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) in northern California and ti...},

abstract = {The full magnitude and complexity of bird migration have not been possible to grasp until after the revolutionary discoveries made with the aid of, e.g., ringing, systematic field observations and radar. These have opened up opportunities for a more formalized theoretical construction work during the recent decades. The introduction of theoretical concepts and tools from flight mechanics into the field of bird flight and migration took place during the 1960s and 1970s and paved the way for the use of optimization analysis to evaluate adaptive aspects of flight behaviour, fuel deposition and responses to wind drift by migrating birds. The approach has been expanded, i.e. through the use of stochastic dynamic programming, to analyse the expected disposition of the migratory journey (with respect to flight and stopover arrangement) under different ecological conditions and the adaptive temporal structure of the annual cycle of a migratory bird. Theoretical considerations also play an important role in analysing the orientation of migratory birds, their population ecology, and patterns of differential migration. Theoretical developments in these areas are reviewed. In the long run evolutionary and mechanistic theories must meet and join to provide a full understanding. While optimization models standing up to critical tests may help to identify primary forces of balancing selection and constraints, mechanistic theories are needed to tell us how the inherent biological algorithms operate within the sensory, neural and physiological systems to control behaviour and design in an adaptive way.},

abstract = {Parasites play pivotal roles in structuring communities, often via indirect interactions with non-host species. These effects can be density-mediated (through mortality) or trait-mediated (behavioural, physiological and developmental), and may be crucial to population interactions, including biological invasions. For instance, parasitism can alter intraguild predation (IGP) between native and invasive crustaceans, reversing invasion outcomes. Here, we use mathematical models to examine how parasite-induced trait changes influence the population dynamics of hosts that interact via IGP. We show that trait-mediated indirect interactions impart keystone effects, promoting or inhibiting host coexistence. Parasites can thus have strong ecological impacts, even if they have negligible virulence, underscoring the need to consider trait-mediated effects when predicting effects of parasites on community structure in general and biological invasions in particular.},

@article{Piersma2016,
abstract = {1. There is increasing concern about the world's animal migrations. With many land-use and climatological changes occurring simultaneously, pinning down the causes of large-scale conservation problems requires sophisticated and data-intensive approaches. 2. Declining shorebird numbers along the East Asian–Australasian Flyway, in combination with data on habitat loss along the Yellow Sea (where these birds refuel during long-distance migrations), indicate a flyway under threat. 3. If habitat loss at staging areas indeed leads to flyway-wide bird losses, we would predict that: (i) decreases in survival only occur during the season that birds use the Yellow Sea, and (ii) decreases in survival occur in migrants that share a reliance on the vanishing intertidal flats along the Yellow Sea, even if ecologically distinct and using different breeding grounds. 4. Monitored from 2006–2013, we analysed seasonal apparent survival patterns of three shorebird species with non-overlapping Arctic breeding areas and considerable differences in foraging ecology, but a shared use of both north-west Australian non-breeding grounds and the Yellow Sea coasts to refuel during northward and southward migrations (red knot Calidris canutus piersmai, great knot Calidris tenuirostris, bar-tailed godwit Limosa lapponica menzbieri). Distinguishing two three-month non-breeding periods and a six-month migration and breeding period, and analysing survival of the three species and the three seasons in a single model, we statistically evaluated differences at both the species and season levels. 5. Whereas apparent survival remained high in north-west Australia, during the time away from the non-breeding grounds survival in all three species began to decline in 2011, having lost 20 percentage points by 2012. By 2012 annual apparent survival had become as low as 071 in bar-tailed godwits, 068 in great knots and 067 in red knots. In a separate analysis for red knots, no mortality occurred during the migration from Australia to China. In the summers of low summer survival, weather conditions were benign in the Arctic breeding areas. 6. We argue that rapid seashore habitat loss in the Yellow Sea is the most likely explanation of reduced summer survival, with dire (but uncertain) forecasts for the future of these flyway populations. This interpretation is consistent with recent findings of declining shorebird numbers at seemingly intact southern non-breeding sites. 7. Policy implications. Due to established economic interests, governments are usually reluctant to act for conservation, unless unambiguous evidence for particular cause–effect chains is apparent. This study adds to an increasing body of evidence that habitat loss along the Yellow Sea shores explains the widespread declines in shorebird numbers along the East Asian–Australasian Flyway and threatens the long-term prospects of several long-distance migrating species. To halt further losses, the clearance of coastal intertidal habitat must stop now.},

abstract = {Whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) were monitored during spring migration across a network of ten aerial transects within the barrier island-lagoon system along the lower Delmarva Peninsula, Virginia, USA. Transects were surveyed weekly from the last week of April through the first week of June (1994-1996, 2008-2009). Whimbrel numbers increased to a peak during the first and second weeks of May then decreased sharply during the third and fourth weeks of May in all years. Between the 1990's and 2000's, peak numbers declined by 50{\%}, corresponding to a 4.2{\%} annual rate of decline. A similar decline was detected in accumulated, season-wide numbers. Though similar in pattern, migration phenology was significantly different between the decades. The phenology difference resulted from a greater reduction in numbers during the first half of the study period compared to the last. Habitats used by Whimbrels (N = 31,314) included mudflats (95{\%}) and salt marshes (5{\%}). Habitat-specific densities (birds/km(2)) were 443 +/- 26.6 and 9 +/- 1.6 (mean +/- SE) for mudflat and marsh patches, respectively, during the 1990's and 222 +/- 11.1 and 8 +/- 4.6 during the 2000's. These results support suggestions that Whimbrels are declining on the Hudson Bay breeding grounds and perhaps at major Atlantic Coast wintering sites.

abstract = {Vigilance in animals decreases with group size in many species of birds and mammals, but the effect of group size can be confounded by several ecological factors, most notably food density. Given that large groups often aggregate in areas of higher food density and that vigilance may be reduced when animals feed more, the group-size effect of vigilance may be confounded by the direct effect of food density on vigilance. In this paper, I examine the theoretical expectations regarding the effect of food density on vigilance and review the available empirical evidence. Two bodies of theory predict either no relationship or a negative relationship between vigilance and food density, but none has been tested explicitly. The empirical support for a negative relationship is mixed given that many studies actually document a positive correlation between vigilance and food density. I review the factors modulating the effect of food density on vigilance and show that there are several reasons to believe that the case against a confounding effect of food density is not as strong as expected. In fact, food density can actually mask the expected decrease in vigilance with group size. A statement about the magnitude of the group-size effect on vigilance will require an assessment of the role of food density as well as the many factors reviewed here that modulate the effect of food density on vigilance in birds and mammals.

abstract = {Environmental conditions influence the breeding and migratory patterns of many avian species and may have particularly dramatic effects on long-distance migrants that breed at northern latitudes. Environment, however, is only one of the ecological variables affecting avian phenology, and recent work shows that migration tactics may be strongly affected by changes in predator populations. We used long-term data from 1978 to 2000 to examine the interactions between snowmelt in western Alaska in relation to the breeding or migration phenologies of small shorebirds and their raptor predators. Although the sandpipers' time of arrival at Alaskan breeding sites corresponded with mean snowmelt, late snowmelts did delay breeding. These delays, however, did not persist to southward migration through British Columbia, likely due to the birds' ability to compensate for variance in the length of the breeding season. Raptor phenology at an early stopover site in British Columbia was strongly related to snowmelt, so that in years of early snowmelt falcons appeared earlier during the sandpipers' southbound migration. These differential effects indicate that earlier snowmelt due to climate change may alter the ecological dynamics of the predator-prey system.},

abstract = {We used a food restriction/refeeding protocol to put birds through a controlled cycle of mass loss and mass gain to investigate the effects of rate and phase of mass change on plasma metabolite levels in relation to diet. Despite marked differences in fat content of the two diets (18{\%} vs 4{\%}) mean rate of mass loss or mass gain was independent of diet. There was also no effect of diet on plasma levels of any of the four measured metabolite (triglyceride, glycerol, uric acid and beta-0H-butyrate) during mass loss. However, during mass gain birds on the low fat diet had higher plasma levels of triglyceride and uric acid and lower P-OH-butyrate than birds gaining mass on the high-fat diet. Thus, diet composition can affect plasma metabolite profiles independently of differences in rates of mass change. Nevertheless, certain plasma metabolites were related to variation in rates of mass change across physiological states. Glycerol levels were negatively related to the rate of mass change (independent of diet), and butyrate was negatively related to the rate of mass change on both diets (though the slope of this relationship was diet dependent). Uric acid was positively related to the rate of mass change but only for birds on the low-fat diet. Our study therefore confirms that measurement of plasma metabolites can provide robust information on physiological state (gain, loss) and the rate of mass change (e.g. in free-living birds caught only once) although researchers should be cogniscent of potential confounding effects of diet composition for certain metabolites, both for field studies and for future experimental validations of this technique.},

abstract = {In Delaware Bay, the spawning of several million horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus) coincides with the arrival of migratory shorebirds that feed on their eggs. High horseshoe crab spawning densities and resulting high egg densities drive egg availability and predation rates. At high spawning densities, female horseshoe crabs perturb previously deposited clutches causing eggs to rise to the sediment surface (surface egg densities average 100,000 eggs m(-2)). At the surface (0-5 cm), the eggs are quickly depleted by shorebirds and other predators. This interaction between egg density and egg predation has not been explicitly explored on beaches with low spawning densities such as on the Connecticut (CT) shore of Long Island Sound (LIS). Spawning indices in LIS (range: 0.002 to 0.02 females m(-2)) are two to three orders of magnitude less than in Delaware Bay (0.7-1.0 females m(-2)). Given the low spawning density and correspondingly low subsurface egg density (x = 1.5 eggs cm(-2)), we predicted that the frequency of egg predation would be rare. A series of exclosures was constructed on two known horseshoe crab spawning beaches to test the frequency and rate of predation on horseshoe crab eggs. There was no significant difference between egg masses initially placed in artificial nests and recovered at the conclusion of each experiment. While shorebirds were observed probing sediments within and outside of experimental plots, eggs were never observed at the surface during this study. Foraging by shorebirds for buried eggs may be energetically prohibitive given the lack of eggs on the surface and the low subsurface egg densities on CT beaches in LIS (range = 0.6-2.4 egg cm(-2)). Limited egg predation by fish was observed but tidal scouring of eggs buried below mean tide primarily drove egg availability for these predators. We conclude that horseshoe crab egg predation is a rare occurrence in Connecticut due to low egg density as a direct result of low spawning densities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The never-ending tension between finding food and avoiding predators may be the most universal natural stressor wild animals experience. The 'chronic stress' hypothesis predicts: (i) an animal's stress profile will be a simultaneous function of food and predator pressures given the aforesaid tension; and (ii) these inseparable effects on physiology will produce inseparable effects on demography because of the resulting adverse health effects. This hypothesis was originally proposed to explain synergistic (inseparable) food and predator effects on demography in snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus). We conducted a 2 x 2, manipulative food addition plus natural predator reduction experiment on song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) that was, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate comparable synergistic effects in a bird: added food and lower predator pressure in combination produced an increase in annual reproductive success almost double that expected from an additive model. Here we report the predicted simultaneous food and predator effects on measures of chronic stress in the context of the same experiment: birds at unfed, high predator pressure (HPP) sites had the highest stress levels; those at either unfed or HPP sites showed intermediate levels; and fed birds at low predator pressure sites had the lowest stress levels.},

abstract="Predator--prey interactions are central to fitness as animals simultaneously avoid death and consume resources to ensure growth and reproduction. Along with direct effects, predators can also exert strong non-consumptive effects. For example, prey shift habitat use in the presence of predators, a potentially learned behavior. The impact of cognition on movement and predator interactions is largely unexplored despite evidence of learned responses to predation threat. We explore how learning and spatial memory influence predator--prey dynamics by introducing predators into a memory-driven movement modeling framework. To model various aspects of risk, we vary predator behavior: their persistence and spatial correlation with the prey's resources. Memory outperforms simpler movement processes most in patchy environments with more predictable predators that are more easily avoided once learned. In these cases, memory aids foragers in managing the food--safety trade-off. For example, particular parameterizations of the predation memory reduce encounters while maintaining consumption. We found that non-consumptive effects are highest in landscapes of concentrated, patchy resources. These effects are intensified when predators are highly correlated with the forager's resources. Smooth landscapes provide more opportunities for foragers to simultaneously consume resources and avoid predators. Predators are able to effectively guard all resources in very patchy landscapes. These non-consumptive effects are also seen with the shift away from the best quality habitat compared to foraging in a predator-free environment.",

abstract = {Birds are vulnerable to collisions with human-made fixed structures. Despite ongoing development and increases in infrastructure, we have few estimates of the magnitude of collision mortality. We reviewed the existing literature on avian mortality associated with transmission lines and derived an initial estimate for Canada. Estimating mortality from collisions with power lines is challenging due to the lack of studies, especially from sites within Canada, and due to uncertainty about the magnitude of detection biases. Detection of bird collisions with transmission lines varies due to habitat type, species size, and scavenging rates. In addition, birds can be crippled by the impact and subsequently die, although crippling rates are poorly known and rarely incorporated into estimates. We used existing data to derive a range of estimates of avian mortality associated with collisions with transmission lines in Canada by incorporating detection, scavenging, and crippling biases. There are 231,966 km of transmission lines across Canada, mostly in the boreal forest. Mortality estimates ranged from 1 million to 229.5 million birds per year, depending on the bias corrections applied. We consider our most realistic estimate, taking into account variation in risk across Canada, to range from 2.5 million to 25.6 million birds killed per year. Data from multiple studies across Canada and the northern U.S. indicate that the most vulnerable bird groups are (1) waterfowl, (2) grebes, (3) shorebirds, and (4) cranes, which is consistent with other studies. Populations of several groups that are vulnerable to collisions are increasing across Canada (e.g., waterfowl, raptors), which suggests that collision mortality, at current levels, is not limiting population growth. However, there may be impacts on other declining species, such as shorebirds and some species at risk, including Alberta's Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) and western Canada's endangered Whooping Cranes (Grus americana). Collisions may be more common during migration, which underscores the need to understand impacts across the annual cycle. We emphasize that these estimates are preliminary, especially considering the absence of Canadian studies. R{\'{E}}SUM{\'{E}}.},

Clams were shallowest (5 mm) at high tide and deepest (25 mm) at low tide. Clam depth was independent of clam size. M. mercenaria migrated vertically in sand, mud, and oyster rubble habitats but not in Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) grass beds. When relocated to a sand habitat, clams from S. alterniflora beds also migrated vertically in concert with tidal phase. Clams exhibited relatively little horizontal movement. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that an increase in pressure caused upward movement of M. mercenaria. Field experiments restricting vertical movements of M. mercenaria showed that clams buried 20 mm or deeper at low tide had reduced risk of gull predation. Predation by avian predators is suggested as a selective pressure in the evolution of the tidally based vertical migration of M. mercenaria.},

abstract = {The relationships between the standing stocks of deposit-feeding benthic invertebrates and benthic chlorophyll-a, phaeopigment and total combustible organic matter were investigated at a series of coastal lagoons and in the type of intertidal soft-sediment sites from which the lagoons originated. Across all the sites, in Norfolk, UK, an inverse relationship occurred between (a) the amounts of chlorophyll-a and of other potential food materials and (b) the degree of coverage by water. The biomass of consumers also decreased with increased water coverage, so that the lagoons supported less biomass than the adjacent high-level intertidal sites. Further, the deposit-feeder biomass supported by unit food decreased with extent of water coverage. There was no evidence of any relationship between deposit-feeder and food biomass within any single site, in spite of the study period being selected to be that in which there was maximum likelihood of competition for microphytobenthic food. Whilst chlorophyll concentrations may set the maximum achievable level of consumer biomass at these sites, including in the deeper lagoons setting very low potential maximum population densities, the seasonal abundance patterns of the deposit feeders appear to be determined by other factor(s).},

abstract = {Negative interactions between humans and wildlife are increasing, often leading to conflict between different stakeholders over appropriate management interventions. We experimentally tested whether introducing trained Harris's hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus) through falconry could be an effective management tool to reduce nuisance Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca). We hypothesized that falconry would result in elevated fear responses of geese, resulting in increased vigilance, reduced favorability of the site, and locally reduced abundance.Weconducted our study on 3 golf courses (1 treatment and 2 controls) in the Western Cape, South Africa, where Egyptian geese are a pest species. Our treatment involved flying the Harris's hawk directly at geese from golf carts. We monitored vigilance and goose numbers before, during, and after treatment. Goose vigilance at the treatment site increased by 76{\%} and abundance declined by 73{\%} following falconry. We did not observe changes at either control site.Although the hawks killed some geese, the decreases in abundance were almost 3 times greater than the numbers killed, indicating that indirect effects were considerably larger than the direct effect of mortality. During the treatment period, vigilance rates were greater in the presence of a golf cart, suggesting that geese learned to associate carts with the threat of predation. Post-treatment vigilance rates were significantly less than rates detected during the treatment period and goose abundance on the experimental site increased rapidly post-treatment, returning to pre- treatment rates within 2 months. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of falconry to reduce nuisance bird abundance and suggest there may be other applications where the deployment of trained predators can be used to mitigate negative human-wildlife interactions.},

abstract = {Migrants have been hypothesised to use different migration strategies between seasons: a time-minimization strategy during their pre-breeding migration towards the breeding grounds and an energy-minimization strategy during their post-breeding migration towards the wintering grounds. Besides season, we propose body size as a key factor in shaping migratory behaviour. Specifically, given that body size is expected to correlate negatively with maximum migration speed and that large birds tend to use more time to complete their annual life-history events (such as moult, breeding and migration), we hypothesise that large-sized species are time stressed all year round. Consequently, large birds are not only likely to adopt a time-minimization strategy during pre-breeding migration, but also during post-breeding migration, to guarantee a timely arrival at both the non-breeding (i.e. wintering) and breeding grounds. We tested this idea using individual tracks across six long-distance migratory shorebird species (family Scolopacidae) along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway varying in size from 50 g to 750 g lean body mass. Migration performance was compared between pre- and post-breeding migration using four quantifiable migratory behaviours that serve to distinguish between a time- and energy-minimization strategy, including migration speed, number of staging sites, total migration distance and step length from one site to the next. During pre- and post-breeding migration, the shorebirds generally covered similar distances, but they tended to migrate faster, used fewer staging sites, and tended to use longer step lengths during pre-breeding migration. These seasonal differences are consistent with the prediction that a time-minimization strategy is used during pre-breeding migration, whereas an energy-minimization strategy is used during post-breeding migration. However, there was also a tendency for the seasonal difference in migration speed to progressively disappear with an increase in body size, supporting our hypothesis that larger species tend to use time-minimization strategies during both pre- and post-breeding migration. Our study highlights that body size plays an important role in shaping migratory behaviour. Larger migratory bird species are potentially time constrained during not only the pre- but also the post-breeding migration. Conservation of their habitats during both seasons may thus be crucial for averting further population declines.},

However, little is known about how stopover habitat, essential for refuelling during migration, affects the population dynamics of migratory species. Using 20 years of continent-wide citizen science data, we assess population trends of ten shorebird taxa that refuel on Yellow Sea tidal mudflats, a threatened ecosystem that has shrunk by {\textgreater}65{\%} in recent decades. Seven of the taxa declined at rates of up to 8{\%} per year. Taxa with the greatest reliance on the Yellow Sea as a stopover site showed the greatest declines, whereas those that stop primarily in other regions had slowly declining or stable populations. Decline rate was unaffected by shared evolutionary history among taxa and was not predicted by migration distance, breeding range size, non-breeding location, generation time or body size. These results suggest that changes in stopover habitat can severely limit migratory populations.},

abstract = {Many dynamical systems, including lakes, organisms, ocean circulation patterns, or financial markets, are now thought to have tipping points where critical transitions to a contrasting state can happen. Because critical transitions can occur unexpectedly and are difficult to manage, there is a need for methods that can be used to identify when a critical transition is approaching. Recent theory shows that we can identify the proximity of a system to a critical transition using a variety of so-called ‘early warning signals', and successful empirical examples suggest a potential for practical applicability. However, while the range of proposed methods for predicting critical transitions is rapidly expanding, opinions on their practical use differ widely, and there is no comparative study that tests the limitations of the different methods to identify approaching critical transitions using time-series data. Here, we summarize a range of currently available early warning methods and apply them to two simulated time series that are typical of systems undergoing a critical transition. In addition to a methodological guide, our work offers a practical toolbox that may be used in a wide range of fields to help detect early warning signals of critical transitions in time series data.},

abstract = {The total organic carbon (TOC) in soils can be estimated by dry and humid combustion methods. Both have some drawbacks, mainly the humid combustion, which demands high reagent quantities and generates toxic waste containing chromium. The Mebius in Block method was developed to decrease the quantity of Na dichromate used in analyses. The objectives of this study were to verify the precision and accuracy of the Mebius in Block compared with other wet and dry combustion methods. The study was performed in two phases at the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria: (a) TOC contents of 18 soil samples of a Rhodic Ferralsol were determined in the 0-5 and 5-10 cm layers, by different practices. The methods evaluated were Walkley-Black, modified Mebius, Mebius in digestion block, and by CO2 capturing; (b) The TOC contents were determined by Mebius in Block and an elementary analyzer of carbon and nitrogen in 75 samples collected in A1 (0-7.5 and 7.5-15 cm layers), A2, E and Bt horizons of a Rhodic Acrisol with five management practices and three replicates. The data precision of the humid combustion methods was similar, with a coefficient of variation (CV) below 10 except for the CO2 capturing method, where the TOC contents were lower, while the variation coefficient was higher. The Mebius-in-block processes a larger number of samples with lower reagent consumption and a greater precision (CV {\textless} 2.60 than the other methods. A factor of correction of 1.14 should be applied to Mebius-in-Block values for an adjustment to those obtained by dry combustion (elementary analyzer).},

abstract = {Empirical studies on the group-size effect (a reduction in time allocated to vigilance with an increase in group size that releases more time for foraging) have generally assumed that the influence of companions is the same irrespective of nearest-neighbour distance. However, social information transmission has been found to be affected by neighbour distance. Our goal was to assess the role of both group size and neighbour distance in explaining foraging and scanning behaviour in flocks of brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater. We conducted a seminatural experiment in which we simultaneously manipulated group size (3, 5, 7 individuals) and minimum neighbour distance (0, 2.5, 5 m) of birds in visual but not physical contact. Foraging and vigilance were affected by both flock size and neighbour distance in different ways. Flock size generally influenced foraging and scanning behaviour, with an initial increase/decrease and then a levelling off at higher flock sizes. Neighbour distance also affected individual behaviour in a nonlinear fashion, but we also found patterns for pecking rate and proportion of time scanning that suggest linear changes. We found that the strength of the group-size effect varied with neighbour distance and was weakest when the birds were furthest away from each other. Future studies should consider as members of a group only those individuals within a radius that allows detection and dilution effects to operate.

abstract = {Shorebirds use stopover sites throughout the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV) to fuel their southern migration. At these stopover sites shorebirds exploit macroinvertebrates as their primary foraging material during migration. Studies from coastal areas suggest that shorebirds can significantly deplete macroinvertebrate abundance and biomass at stopover sites. Whether these results are true for the LMAV remains to be evaluated. An exclosure experiment was conducted on five National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) stretching 400 km throughout the LMAV to see if shorebird foraging impacted macroinvertebrate community composition, abundance and standing stock biomass. Macroinvertebrates were sampled in the late summer of 2001 and 2002 from exclosure areas and open areas and compared using 2-sample paired t-tests. Community composition was relatively similar between the five refuges sampled. Macroinvertebrate abundances ranged from 300 to 433,000 individuals/m(2) with a mean of 66,500 ( 6000) individuals/m(2). Shorebird foraging had no significant impact on abundance. Macroinvertebrate biomass ranged from less than 0.1 to greater than 24.4 g ash free dry mass (AFDM)m(2) with a mean of 3.43 (+/- 0.35) g AFDM/m(2). With the exception of one sampling date, 21 August 2001 at Bald Knob NWR, shorebird foraging did not significantly impact macroinvertebrate biomass. On the exceptional date, the difference was due to a reduction of Chironomidae larvae, which was neither the most abundant macroinvertebrate present nor the macroinvertebrate comprising the highest biomass. Results of this study suggest that, at present, shorebirds do not have a significant impact on foraging material in the LMAV flyway during their southern migration. However, with continued degradation to other interior regions and increased promotion of shorebird management in the LMAV, the potential exists for shorebirds to increase in numbers high enough to cause significant impacts in the future.},

abstract = {In most birds, flight is the most important means of escape from predators. Impaired flight abilities due to increased wing loading may increase vulnerability to predation. To compensate for an increase in wing loading, birds are able to independently decrease body mass (BM) or increase pectoral muscle mass (PMM). Comparing nearshore and farshore foraging shorebird species, we develop a theory as to which of these responses should be the most appropriate. We hypothesize that nearshore foragers should respond to increased predation by increasing their PMM in order to promote speed-based escape. Instead, farshore foragers should decrease BM in order to improve agility for maneuvering escape. Experiments on 2 shorebird species are consistent with these predictions, but on the basis of the theoretical framework for evaluating effect size and biological significance developed here, more experiments are clearly needed.},

abstract = {Ecological mismatches between reproductive events and seasonal resource peaks are frequently proposed to be a key driver of population dynamics resulting from global climate change. Many local populations are experiencing reduced reproductive success as a consequence of mismatches, but few mismatches have led to species-level population declines. To better understand this apparent paradox, we investigated the breeding phenology and chick survival of two disjunct populations of Hudsonian godwits Limosa haemastica breeding at Churchill, Manitoba and Beluga River, Alaska. Only one population experienced a mismatch: godwits bred nearly one week after the onset of the invertebrate peak at Churchill because of asynchronous climatic change occurring throughout their annual cycle. However, chicks were not uniformly aff ected by the mismatch — growth rates and survival of young chicks were not correlated with invertebrate abundance, but older chicks tended to suff er lower survival rates on days of low invertebrate abundance. Ecological mismatches thus resulted in a complex array of consequences, but nonetheless contributed to reductions in chick survival. In contrast, godwits at Beluga River hatched their chicks just before the invertebrate peak, such that the period of highest energetic need coincided with the period of highest invertebrate abundance. As a result, growth rates and survival of godwit chicks were unaff ected by invertebrate abundance. Godwits at Beluga River were able to properly time their reproduction because of predictable rates of climatic change and strong selection imposed by high predation on late-hatched chicks. Taken together, our results suggest that population-specifi c, local-scale selection pressures play a critical role in determining the degree and severity of ecological mismatches. Th e potential for global climate change to induce species-level population declines may therefore be mediated by the spatial variation in the selection pressures acting across a species ' range.},

abstract = {We investigated the stopover patterns of male and female Curlew Sandpipers at a stopover area in northeast Spain. Curlew Sandpipers were trapped and colour-ringed during autumn migration in 1992 and 1993. Stopover length was similar to those reported previously for this and other waders that migrate using a small number of widely separated staging areas, but were greater than stopovers reported for other tenders that migrate using it large number of staging areas separated by short distances. The differences in stopover length between the birds using these two strategies could be related to the fuel reserves that have to be accumulated to reach the next staging area. Males stayed longer in the area than females. Seasonal changes in prey availability or sex differences in moulting and migratory patterns do Mot account far these differences in stopover ecology. Following a time-selected model of optimal migration, sex differences in stopover ecology could be related to a dominance of the larger females over the males or to a higher foraging efficiency or a shorter search and settling time in females. Whether these differences are restricted to the studied area or are widespread in other staging areas used by the species could be important for assessing the possible differences in the migration speed of Curlew Sandpipers. The finding that males leave the breeding grounds 21-35 days before females but arrive at the study area with only a 10-day difference supports the hypothesis that females migrate faster than males at least in the first half of their migration.},

abstract = {Resident species typically undergo post-nuptial moult directly following breeding, whereas long-distance migrant species usually do so after arrival at stagoing or non-breeding ('wintering') grounds. It has been suggested that moult and migration are mutually exclusive activities. If so, one will displace the other in time. We contrasted the moult timing of migrant versus non-migrant Western Sandpipers Calidris mauri, taking advantage of the fact that in Panama, most yearling birds (11-22 months of age), and some adults, were non-migratory summer residents. Yearling birds and other summer residents completed primary moult approximately 3-4 weeks earlier than adults returning from the breeding grounds. The same general pattern occurs with contour moult. Some adults of unknown migratory status also have moult patterns similar to summer residents. We interpret these patterns as indicating that earlier moult is advantageous, partially compensating residents for not migrating and breeding that year. We consider potential mechanisms that may favour an earlier moult, and discuss how moult schedules may influence Western Sandpiper migratory and life history strategies.},

abstract = {We review the concepts and research associated with measuring fear and its consequences for foraging. When foraging, animals should and do demand hazardous duty pay. They assess a foraging cost of predation to compensate for the risk of predation or the risk of catastrophic injury. Similarly, in weighing foraging options, animals tradeoff food and safety. The foraging cost of predation can be modelled, and it can be quantitatively and qualitatively measured using risk titrations. Giving-up densities (GUDs) in depletable food patches and the distribution of foragers across safe and risky feeding opportunities are two frequent experimental tools for titrating food and safety. A growing body of literature shows that: (i) the cost of predation can be big and comprise the forager's largest foraging cost, (ii) seemingly small changes in habitat or microhabitat characteristics can lead to large changes in the cost of predation, and (iii) a forager's cost of predation rises with risk of mortality, the forager's energy state and a decrease in its marginal value of energy. In titrating for the cost of predation, researchers have investigated spatial and temporal variation in risk, scale-dependent variation in risk, and the role of predation risk in a forager's ecology. A risk titration from a feeding animal often provides a more accurate behavioural indicator of predation risk than direct observations of predator-inflicted mortality. Titrating for fear responses in foragers has some well-established applications and holds promise for novel methodologies, concepts and applications. Future directions for expanding conceptual and empirical tools include: what are the consequences of foraging costs arising from interference behaviours and other sources of catastrophic loss? Are there alternative routes by which organisms can respond to tradeoffs of food and safety? What does an animal's landscape of fear look like as a spatially explicit map, and how do various environmental factors affect it? Behavioural titrations will help to illuminate these issues and more.},

abstract = {Studies of inducible defenses have traditionally examined prey responses to one predator at a time. However, prey in nature encounter combinations of predators that should force them to produce phenotypic compromises. We examined how snails (Helisoma trivolvis) alter their phenotype in the presence of three different predator species that were presented alone and in pairwise combinations. When snails were exposed to each predator alone, they formed predator-specific defenses that reflected the differences in each predator's foraging mode. When snails were exposed to pairwise combinations of predators, their phenotype was dependent on their ability to detect each predator, the risk posed by each predator, and the effectiveness of a given defense against each predator. Consequently, responses to combined predators were typically biased towards one of the predators in the pair. This suggests that prey facing combined predators do not form simple intermediate defenses and, as a result, may experience enhanced mortality risk when they encounter natural predator regimes.},

abstract = {Flight directions and routes of migrating birds are determined by the birds' compass orientation, but also by effects of wind, social influence, responses to topography and landmarks, and to navigation cues. We investigated the orientation and routes taken by arctic shorebirds during autumn migration in southern Sweden at three different sites situated within a distance of 200 km from each other, in relation to the birds' destinations. We used three different methods, visual telescope observations, tracking radar registration and ring recoveries. Mean track directions differed significantly between the different sites in a way that demonstrated fine-scaled orientation changes when the shorebirds passed the southern Baltic region. The gradual change cannot be explained by different wind conditions at the different sites or by distinct responses to specific topographical features, i.e. the birds were not following coastlines or prominent landmarks in any detailed way. Neither could it be reconciled with orientation according to any of the main compass mechanisms known to be used by migrating birds which indicates that the control of flight courses and paths may be more complex than expected. The shorebirds might travel within a slightly winding flight corridor in broad agreement with the large-scale topography to maximize general association with coastal habitats during migration. Juvenile birds had a significantly different orientation than adults, particularly when the juveniles travelled in flocks without any adults. Juvenile birds may learn the general flight paths and course changes in relation to the large-scale topography from older and experienced individuals in the flocks, but most of this learning process between generations probably does not take place until after the birds' first autumn migration.},

abstract = {Species-area relationships (SPARs) dictate a sea change in the strategies of biodiversity conservation. SPARs exist at three ecological scales: Sample-area SPARs (a larger area within a biogeographical province will tend to include more habitat types, and thus more species, than a smaller one), Archipelagic SPARs (the islands of an archipelago show SPARS that combine the habitat-sampling process with the problem of dispersal to an island), and Interprovincial SPARs (other things being equal, the speciation rates of larger biogeographical provinces are higher and their extinction rates are lower, leading to diversities in proportion to provincial area). SPARs are the products of steady-state dynamics in diversity, and such dynamics appears to have characterized the earth for most of the last 500 million years. As people reduce the area available to wild species, they impose a linear reduction of the earth's species diversity that will follow the largest of these scales, i.e. each 1{\%} reduction of natural area will cost about 1{\%} of steady-state diversity. Reserving small tracts of wild habitat can only delay these reductions. But we can stop most of them by redesigning anthropogenic habitats so that their use is compatible with use by a broad array of other species. That is reconciliation ecology. Many pilot projects, whether intentionally or inadvertently espousing reconciliation ecology, are demonstrating that it can be done.},

Six plasma metabolite levels were examined in free-living Erithacus rubecula, Sylvia atricapilla, S. borin and Ficedula hypoleuca. 2. Plasma triglyceride concentration showed a very discriminating response to feeding activity and metabolic requirements, and the following factors were shown to affect the diurnal pattern of plasma triglyceride concentration: (a) moult affected the slope of the diurnal increase in plasma triglyceride concentration; (b) the amount of food ingested (hyperphagia) affected the levels of plasma triglycerides; (c) the diurnal activity pattern (feeding pattern) affected the shape of the diurnal triglyceride pattern. 3. Plasma free fatty-acid and glycerol concentrations showed no or only slight diurnal trends, in accordance with the absence of increased levels in overnight fasted birds. Plasma uric acid levels did not show diurnal trends, despite generally lower levels at the end of the night. 4. Plasma $\beta$-hydroxy-butyrate levels decreased very quickly in the early morning from the high levels observed in overnight fasted birds. 5. Plasma glucose levels increased during the course of the day only in birds during the migratory period, probably as a response to hyperphagia.},

abstract = {We investigated the pattern of distribution of intertidal soft-bottom fauna in streams and lagoons of the Uruguayan coast at three spatial scales. The Rio de la Plata and the Atlantic Ocean produce on this coast a large-scale gradient in salinity, defining a freshwater (west), an estuarine (central) and a marine (east) region. Within each region, there are several streams and coastal lagoons (sites) that define a second scale of variability. A third scale is given by intertidal gradients within each site. Species richness and total abundance was low in the freshwater west region and high in the central and east regions. The community in the west region was characterized by the clam Curbicula fluminea; in the other regions, it was dominated mainly by the polychaete Heteromastus similis. The polychaete Nephtys fluviatilis was more abundant in the east region, while another polychaete, Laeonereis acuta, characterized the central region. Sediment fractions did not vary significantly at this scale. At the scale of the sites, species richness and total macrofaunal abundance were higher in coastal lagoons than in streams. Coarse sands were more common in coastal lagoons, while medium and fine sand characterized the sediment in streams. Within each site, species richness and total abundance increased towards the lower intertidal level; the macrofauna of the upper levels were a subsample of the fauna occurring at the lower levels. There was also a significantly lower proportion of fine sand at the upper level. At regional scales, the observed patterns may be indirectly or directly related to the gradient in salinity, through differential physiological tolerance to osmotic stress. At the scale of the sites, variability may be explained mainly by geomorphological and sedimentological differences between lagoons and streams. Variation among levels may be related to gradients in desiccation, colonization and predation.},

abstract = {Predictions of global circulation models (GCMs) that account for increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols in the atmosphere show that warming in the Arctic will be amplified in response to the melting of sea ice and snow cover. There is now conclusive evidence that much of the Arctic has warmed in recent decades. Northern Alaska is one region where significant warming has occurred, especially during winter and spring. We investigate how the changing climate of northern Alaska has influenced the annual cycle of snow cover there and in turn, how changes in snow cover perturb the region's surface radiation budget and temperature regime. The focus is on Barrow, Alaska, for which comprehensive data sets exist. A review of earlier studies that documented a trend toward an earlier disappearance of snow in spring is given. Detection and monitoring activities at Barrow are described, and records of snow disappearance from other sites in the Alaskan Arctic are compared. Correlated variations and trends in the date of final snowmelt (melt date) are found by examining several independent time series. Since the mid-1960s the melt date in northern Alaska has advanced by ∼;8 days. The advance appears to be a consequence of decreased snowfall in winter, followed by warmer spring conditions. These changes in snowfall and temperature are attributed to variations in regional circulation patterns. In recent decades, there has been a higher frequency of northerly airflow during winter that tends to diminish snowfall over northern Alaska. During spring, however, intrusions of warm moist air from the North Pacific have become more common, and these tend to accelerate the ablation of snow on the North Slope of Alaska. One result of an earlier melt date is an increase in the net surface radiation budget. At Barrow, net radiative forcing can exceed 150 W m−2 on a daily basis immediately following the last day of snowmelt, and as a result of an 8-day advance in this event, we estimate an increase of ∼2 W m−2 on an annual basis. Our results are in general agreement with earlier analyses suggesting that reductions in snow cover over a large portion of the Arctic on an annual basis have contributed to a warming of the Northern Hemisphere (NH). In addition, the terrestrial ecosystems of the region are very sensitive to snow cover variations. There is growing concern that these perturbations are anthropogenically forced and adapting to these environmental changes will have significant social and economic consequences. While observed decreases in NH snow cover are in broad agreement with GCM simulations, our analyses suggest that internal (or natural) shifts in circulation patterns underlie the observed variations. Continued monitoring and further study is needed to determine whether the earlier disappearance of snow cover in spring in northern Alaska is an indicator of greenhouse-forced global warming or is a manifestation of a more natural, long-term cycle of climate change.},

abstract = {At Boundary Bay, British Columbia, Canada, Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) captured 94 Dunlins (Calidris alpina) in 652 hunts. The two main hunting methods were open attacks on flying Dunlins (62{\%}) and stealth attacks on roosting or foraging Dunlins (35{\%}). Peregrines hunted throughout the day, yet the kill rate per observation hour dropped 1-2 hr before high tide and peaked 1-2 hr after high tide. The drop in kill rate coincided with the departure of the mass of Dunlins for over-ocean flights lasting 2-4 hr. The peak in kill rate occurred just after the tide began to ebb and the Dunlins returned to forage in the shore zone. The hypothesis that closeness to shoreline vegetation is dangerous for Dunlins is supported by three converging lines of evidence: (1) the high success rate (44{\%}) of peregrine hunts over the shore zone compared to the rate (11{\%}) over tide flats and ocean; (2) the high kill rate per observation hour at high tide; and (3) the positive correlation of kill rate with the height of the tides. Seven of 13 Dunlins killed by Merlins (Falco columbarius) and all five Dunlins killed by Northern Harriers (Circus cyaneus) were also captured in the shore zone.},

The proportion of adults and juveniles in the sample did not follow a regular pattern, suggesting that first-year birds migrate to a different area. In every month, adult females outnumbered the males, indicating partial spatial segregation of the sexes. Analysis of variance of body mass demonstrates the presence of two groups of migrants in the area. Birds arriving in August use the Bay as a stopover site until late November, when a second wave arrives for the rest of the boreal winter.},

abstract = {In some conservation situations, there is a need for estimates of numbers of seabirds migrating past a specific site, such as sites of proposed offshore wind farms. Migration counts from points strategically located on the coast can be a reliable and effective method of reaching this goal. We propose a consistent and statistically robust method for estimating such numbers by generalized additive modeling of the numbers passing during periods when counts are interrupted. This procedure has the advantage of accounting for the effects of covariates, such as wind, on the counts in a flexible manner, potentially increasing accuracy and precision. We develop a reliable method of estimating precision, based on a parametric bootstrap, and applied a sensitivity analysis to our models to test their accuracy. We demonstrate the method with three species of seabirds migrating through the Strait of Gibraltar. Estimated numbers of the Northern Gannet (Morus bassanus) are similar to the estimated Atlantic population that winters in the western Mediterranean Sea, while for both Cory's (Calonectris diomedea) and Balearic (Puffinus mauretanicus) Shearwaters they are greater than the current population estimates. These results have important implications in conservation and highlight the necessity for reestimation of the latter two species' global population. Potential sources of biases include the constraint on detectability due to distance and the possibility of double counting due to local movements. To avoid overestimates, we suggest that values imputed for the gaps in counts be conservative.},

I or each of these optimization criteria different fattening, and stopover strategies are predicted. The first two of these optimization criteria are examined here Cor the bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica). In the European Wadden Sea two populations of bar-tailed godwits stop over during spring migration between their wintering and breeding areas. The European population fainter, mainly in Great Britain and the western part of the Wadden Sea and breeds in Fennoscandia, The Afro-Siberian population winters in West Africa and breeds in Siberia. The European wintering, population migrates to the eastern parts of Wadden Sea in March where it stays until earls May, During this time birds gain 1.9 g d(-1) in body mass for a 1500-2000-km non-stop flight to the breeding areas. Afro-Siberian birds stay only for one month in May in the Wadden Sea where they gain oil average 9.4 g d(-1) in mass Cor a 4000-km non-stop flight, Intake rates in April May did not differ between the two populations (1.5 kJ min(-1) and 1.8 kJ min(-1) for Siberian and European migrant. respectively) but total energy intake was higher for the Siberian migrant, since they spend 50{\%} of the day foraging vs 30{\%} in the European birds. In contrast to European migrant. Afro-Siberian birds start to moult into breeding plumage already in their winter quarters, During their stopover in the Wadden Sea thermostatic costs are lower than at times Mien European birds are present. Thus, the higher energy demands of the Afro-Siberian birds seem to be fulfilled by a combination of physiological adaptations and a high working level. European birds seem to adopt an energy-minimized migration strategy whereas Afro-Siberian birds appear to a time-minimized migration.},

@misc{Salewski2007,
abstract = {We approach the problem of the evolution of bird migration by asking whether migration evolves towards new breeding areas or towards survival areas in the non-breeding season. Thus, we avoid the ambiguity of the usually discussed "southern-home-theory" or "northern-home-theory". We argue that migration evolved in birds that spread to seasonal habitats through gradual dispersal to enhance survival during the non-breeding season; this in contrast to the alternative idea suggesting that migration evolved towards new breeding areas to increase reproductive success. Our synthesis is based on the threshold model explaining how migratory traits can change rapidly through microevolutionary processes. Our model brings former theories together and explains how bird migration, with the appropriate direction and time program, evolves through selection after genetically non-directed events such as dispersal and colonization. The model does not need the former untested assumptions such as competition as a reason for migration and for the disappearance of sedentary populations or higher reproductive success in temperate breeding areas. Our theory offers answers to questions such as how birds with a southern origin may gradually reach northern latitudes, why migration routes may follow historical expansion routes and why birds leave an area for the non-breeding season and move back instead of breeding on their wintering grounds. The theory proposes gradual change through selection and not sudden changes such as long distance dispersal or mutations and can be applied to migration at all latitudes and in all directions. The scenario provides a reasonable concept to understand most of the existing migratory phenomena on the basis of the ecology and genetics of migratory behaviour.},

abstract = {Animals can reduce their uncertainty of predation risk by attuning to antipredator behavior of others or assessing the risk for themselves. Although it has never been empirically examined in the context of predation, we predicted that animals combine information gleaned from others with their own sampling experience to estimate risk. To test this prediction, we assessed the state-dependent mobbing responses of migrant and resident songbirds at a fall migration stopover site in eastern Canada to stimuli simulating a range of predation risk situations. We presented individuals with social cues in the form of playbacks of black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) mob-calls conveying graded information about predator size in combination with a predator model (one of two owl species) that rendered the social information either correct or incorrect. The response did not differ based on migratory state; both migrant and resident birds stayed longer at experimental trials when presented with erroneous social information. In particular, response duration of birds presented with a low-threat chickadee mob-call and a high-threat model (understating the risk) was substantially longer than the response to other low-threat call trials, suggesting that individuals were capable of Bayesian updating by devaluing the social cue and acting on their own assessment.},

abstract = {We show that, as previously described, there are conflicts between areas used by people and shorebirds. However, we propose that burrowing organisms add complexity to the shorebird-human interaction that should be taken into account for management and conservation. This is because SW Atlantic mudflats are dominated by high densities (up to 60 crabs m(-2)) of a strong bioturbator, the burrowing crab Neohelice granulata (=Chasmagnathus granulatus). These crabs affect the habitat use and foraging performance of shorebird species. The two-banded plover Charadrius falklandicus feed more in burrow areas whereas the yellowlegs Tringa spp. and the white-rumped sandpiper Calidris fuscicollis tend to avoid burrow areas. We evaluated the effect of human recreational activities on shorebirds, taking into account shorebird-crab interaction, during shorebird migratory periods (November to April) of 2001, 2002, and 2003. This study was performed at the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (37 degrees 40' S, Argentina). Results showed that people only rarely used the extensive soft bottom intertidals dominated by burrowing assemblages of N. granulata because the soft sediments make walking difficult. Therefore, human impact is reduced for the two-banded plover. However, for several migratory shorebirds that also avoid burrow areas, these areas act as suboptimal alternative areas when human impact is important in their preferred habitats. When human activity is low, shorebirds remain foraging in the area but they decrease their feeding intakes. The extensions of burrow areas differ among estuaries and are likely to generate between-estuaries differences as stopover sites for shorebirds. Also, other species that form large burrowing assemblages can have a similar impact on shorebird-human interactions.},

abstract = {For birds and many other animal taxa, surveys that collect count data form a primary source of information on population change. Because counts are only indices to population size, care must be taken in using them in analyses of population change. Temporal or geographic differences in the proportion of animals counted can be misinterpreted as differences in population size. Therefore, temporally or geographically varying factors that influence the proportion of animals counted must be incorporated as covariables in the analysis of population parameters from count data. We describe the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) for illustration. The BBS is a major, landscape-level survey of birds in North America; it is typical of many count surveys, in that the same sample units (survey routes) are sampled each year, and change is modeled on these routes over time. We identify covariables related to observer ability, the omission of which can bias estimation of population change from BBS data. Controlling for observer effects or other potential sources of confounding requires the specification of models relating counts to population size. We begin with a partial model specification relating expected counts to population sizes; we describe estimators currently in use in relation to this partial specification. Additional assumptions lead to a class of overdispersed multinomial models, for which we describe estimators of population change and procedures for parsimonious model selection. We illustrate the use of overdispersed multinomial models by an application to data for Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus).},

abstract = {Wintering turnstones Arenaria interpres have previously been shown to gain anti-predator vigilance benefits when foraging from flocking with certain other wader species (purple sandpipers Calidris maritima, oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus and redshanks Tringa totanus) as well as conspecifics. They also experience less competition and aggression when flocking with these other species than when associating with conspecifics. Cost-benefit models therefore predict that they should prefer mixed-species to single-species flocks. This was examined both by measuring the species compositions of flocks in which foraging turnstones were found and by recording the response of turnstones to natural and manipulated reductions in the density of these other species. Turnstones showed a decreasing tendency to flock together, and an increasing tendency to associate with other species, as the area available for foraging increased with the dropping tide. A decrease in the abundance of oystercatchers and redshanks in the spring (due to their earlier migration to breeding areas) led to greater clumping by turnstones, so that flock densities around individual turnstones were maintained. In contrast, purple sandpipers, which do not gain vigilance benefits from oystercatchers and redshanks, showed no tendency to preferentially associate with them and did not change their own dispersion when these left. Turnstones also formed denser flocks in response to short-term experimental reductions in the abundance of other species. The results indicate that turnstones adjust their own dispersion in relation to the abundance of certain other species. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1989 Nordic Society Oikos},

abstract = {Studies of climate change typically consider measurements or predictions of temperature over extended periods of time. Climate, however, is much more than temperature. Over the oceans, changes in wind speed and the surface gravity waves generated by such winds play an important role. We used a 23-year database of calibrated and validated satellite altimeter measurements to investigate global changes in oceanic wind speed and wave height over this period. We find a general global trend of increasing values of wind speed and, to a lesser degree, wave height, over this period. The rate of increase is greater for extreme events as compared to the mean condition.},

abstract = {We combined radiotelemetry, plasma metabolite analyses, and macro-invertebrate prey sampling to investigate variation in putative fattening rates (estimated as plasma triglyceride levels) at the flyway scale in Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) migrating between Punta Banda, Mexico (31 degrees N), and Hartney Bay, Alaska (60 degrees N), a distance of 4,240 km. Birds were caught at a wintering site (San Francisco Bay) and eight stopover sites along this Pacific Flyway. Body mass was higher in females than in males at six sites, but variation was not correlated with latitude for either sex, and the relationship of change in mass by date within sites was uninformative with regard to possible latitudinal variation in fattening rates. At San Francisco Bay, triglyceride levels were higher in the spring than in the winter. Mean plasma triglyceride varied among stopover sites, and there was a significant linear trend of increasing triglyceride levels with latitude as birds migrated north. At San Francisco Bay, length of stay was negatively related to triglyceride levels. However, plasma triglyceride levels at wintering or initial stopover sites (San Francisco and Punta Banda) did not predict individual variation in subsequent rates of travel during migration. We found no significant relationship between triglyceride levels and prey biomass at different stopover sites, which suggests that the latitudinal pattern is not explained by latitudinal changes in food availability. Rather, we suggest that differences in physiology of migratory birds at southern versus northern stopover sites or behavioral differences may allow birds to sustain higher fattening rates closer to the breeding grounds.},

abstract = {Potential community effects of nutrient enhancement are a topic of theoretical interest and increasing management concern in coastal marine systems. While increased nutrient levels may lead to increased microalgal production and biomass, studies have provided variable evidence regarding the existence of upward cascade effects on rnacrofauna. In benthic marine communities, limitation by predation or factors preventing recruitment response may contribute to weak coupling between resource availability and macrobenthos abundances. We conducted blocked nutrient addition and predator exclusion experiments in the intertidal of two estuaries that varied in background nutrient concentrations (Cape Fear and White Oak, southeastern North Carolina). Benthic community comparisons were also made among these and two other North Carolina estuaries to examine correlations in distribution patterns. Cape Fear, which had the highest background nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, also had highest ambient benthic microalgal biomass. There was no significant response of microalgal biomass to local nutrient additions in Cape Fear and only one macrofaunal taxon during one season exhibited abundance responses to nutrient additions. White Oak, with lower background nutrient levels, was characterized by significant microalgal responses to nutrient additions and significant macrofauna abundance responses for 50{\%} of the species examined during summer experiments. However, all of these macrofauna declined in abundance with nutrient enhancement while biomass remained constant or significantly increased with nutrient additions. This suggests a complex response of rnacrofauna to nutrient additions in this estuary with greater biomass per individual but a corresponding decline in abundances. Top-down/bottom-up interactive effects were observed for haustoriid amphipods, which were uncommon or absent when predators had access, but exhibited strong biomass responses to nutrient enhancement when predators were excluded. These results support a growing body of literature that indicates the importance of background conditions in regulating benthic community responses to nutrient enhancement. However, responses may be complex with biomass per individual rather than densities being the primary response variable for some taxa and predator moderation of responses occurring for some taxa but not others.

abstract = {1. Despite covering a relatively small area on a global scale, estuarine tidal flats are vital to many aquatic bird species during much of the yearly cycle. Small-scale features of tidal flats, such as water drainage channels, can influence the carrying capacity of estuarine wetlands, yet their ecological impact is poorly understood. In this study we evaluated the influence of drainage channels on the quality of feeding habitat for waders in the Tagus estuary, Portugal. 2. We measured the abundance of seven wader species at five distance classes from drainage channels, and analysed the variation in peck rates, step rates, turning rates and success rates. In addition we measured the density of macroinvertebrate prey and the sediment physical-chemical characteristics at different distances from the channels. 3. All wader species occurred at higher densities near the channels. In the study area 44{\%} of the birds fed on just 12{\%} of the available surface, less than 5 m away from drainage channels. Wader foraging behaviour also suggests a greater feeding effort near the channels. 4. While the characteristics of the sediments did not change significantly with distance from channels, prey abundance corresponded closely with wader abundance, suggesting that the small scale distribution of birds on the tidal flats may be related to the presence of their prey. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the areas around drainage channels are particularly important feeding sites for waders foraging on tidal flats. Consequently, managers of estuarine wetlands should strive to preserve or improve channel networks. This can be achieved by (i) preserving saltmarshes and saltpans adjacent to tidal flats, (ii) minimizing the reclamation of upshore flats and (iii) avoiding embankments and canalizations of inland water flows that reduce the number of water entry points onto tidal flats.},

abstract = {Structured habitats in estuaries provided by seagrass beds are valued as nurseries for economically valuable and ecologically important fish and crustacean species, explaining why much effort has been expended to restore and protect these habitats. Data on ecological dynamics in seagrass beds are necessary for assessing natural variability and understanding potential impacts from future anthropogenic disturbances. We quantified benthic communities in marine mud flat and seagrass bed habitats throughout Casco Bay, Maine, USA to examine nursery functions. We hypothesized that mobile fish and crustaceans are more abundant in seagrass habitat because this habitat provides refuge, and that mobile predators that use eelgrass beds reduce populations of infaunal prey in adjacent mud flats. Our results indicate seagrass beds are important nursery habitat, and that seagrass presence in an embayment affects the abundance and diversity of local fish and invertebrate communities. Specifically, fish and native mobile crustacean populations were generally most abundant in and adjacent to seagrass beds among habitats studied. Our results also suggest that the proximity of seagrass to mudflats potentially influences community structure within mudflats by affecting predator access. Human activities that result in the degradation of seagrass beds and other biogenic habitats will likely influence community structure and impair ecosystem function in estuaries. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Nordic Society Oikos.Birds may change their diet and foraging habitat during or after migration. Dunlins Calidris alpina alpina breed in the tundra of northern Europe and Russia where they feed exclusively on terrestrial prey. However, up to 80{\%} of the flyway population uses the Wadden Sea as their first important staging site on the way to wintering grounds, feeding exclusively on marine prey. Adult birds migrate earlier than immatures and tend to fly non-stop, whereas immatures may stage for at least a few days en route, mainly in the Baltic region. There they mostly feed on brackish water prey showing similar isotopic values compared to terrestrial prey. When they arrive in the Wadden Sea, dunlin body reserves are depleted and lower than those of individuals that have already staged for several days. We hypothesized that lighter individuals should retain a strong terrestrial isotopic blood signature, while heavier ones should show a stronger marine signature. We found a significant positive correlation between scaled mass index and carbon ($\delta$13C) and nitrogen ($\delta$15N) stable isotopes, reflecting the switch from terrestrial to marine prey during migration. A mixing model revealed differences in isotopic values between heavy and light adults and immatures, respectively, in relation to the isotopic prey signatures. Adults showed stronger marine signals compared with immatures, emphasizing the different modes of migration (i.e. a later departure in immatures) as well as the known spatial segregation of age classes in the Wadden Sea, i.e. adults use tidal flats distant from the shore while immatures use coastal areas influenced by terrestrial carbon sources. The results of this study demonstrate the value of scaled mass index in migratory birds as an indicator of time elapsed after diet switching following migration. Furthermore, this study extents the existing knowledge on the timing of dunlin migration by using an isotopic approach.},

abstract = {We evaluated how links between direct and indirect interactions and physical disturbance shaped trophic dynamics in a soft-sediment benthic estuarine community. We crossed presence of burrow-excavating crabs Pachygrapsus crassipes and nutrient enrichment (nitrogen and phosphorus) in cages containing herbivorous surface-feeding snails Cerithidea californica and benthic microalgae in a tidal mudflat and a tidal sandflat in Mugu Lagoon, southern California, USA. P. crassipes consumed up to 85 {\%} of C. californica in enclosures, but there was no evidence of a trophic cascade, as crab reduction of snail density did not increase benthic microalgal biomass. Rather, P. crassipes decreased diatom and cyanobacterial biomass by up to 50 {\%} in the mudflat and 80 {\%} in the sandflat, probably via bioturbation. Subadult C. californica lengths increased 15 to 20 {\%} over 5 wk in treatments without crabs. In the presence of P. crassipes, C. californica lengths increased {\textless} 5 {\%}, probably an indirect result of crab reduction of microalgal food availability or increased snail burial. C. californica may have actively burrowed as an escape response from the crabs, or have been passively buried during crab burrowing activities. Nutrient addition did not reduce snail growth, but increased snail mortality at both sites, possibly a result of nutrient-induced shifts towards toxic or poor nutritive quality cyanobacteria. The top-down impacts of P. crassipes reduced the relative bottom-up effects of nutrients in this habitat, illustrating the importance of evaluating both biotic and abiotic interactions simultaneously. Numerous indirect and non-trophic interactions revealed a community structure that was much more complex than suggested by food web structure.},

abstract = {The composition of depot fat in Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) was dominated by C sub(16) and C sub(18) fatty acids (palmitate, 16:0; palmitoleate, 16:1; stearate, 18:0; oleate, 18:1), which together comprised 80 to 90{\%} of all fatty acids analyzed. Significant seasonal variation occurred in the relative proportion of specific fatty acids and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in relation to the migratory cycle of the sandpipers. In adults of both sexes, the proportion of 16:0 and 18:0 fatty acids decreased from winter (December) to premigration (March) to spring migration (May), whereas the proportion of 16:1 and 18:1 fatty acids increased over these same periods. Consequently, total unsaturated fatty acids increased by 34{\%} between the winter and premigratory phase, and by a further 22{\%} between premigration and spring migration. Therefore, biochemical modification of adipose tissue in Western Sandpipers begins during the premigratory period in preparation for long-distance flight but continues as migration progresses, perhaps reflecting a training component of physiological modulation for migration. Juveniles showed similar changes to adults in the composition of their depot fat during the "premigratory" period, even though most juveniles do not undergo hyperphagia or rapid fattening at this wintering site. Potential prey species collected from a wintering site in Panama had a higher proportion of saturated fatty acids, less 16:1 and 18:1, and more 18:0 fatty acid compared with those from a migratory stopover site in British Columbia, paralleling the seasonal changes in depot fatty-acid composition observed in Western Sandpipers. However, the fact that Western Sandpipers show an increase in level of unsaturation and in the amounts of 16:1 and 18:1 fatty acids in their fat stores on the wintering ground prior to migration suggests that seasonal variation in fatty-acid composition is not entirely diet dependent.},

abstract = {American Falls Reservoir in southeastern Idaho is an irrigation reservoir used as an inland feeding stopover by many shorebird species. Six exclosure experiments were conducted during the 1990 drawdown period to investigate shorebird predation impact on benthic macroinvertebrate populations. The study sites differed in sediment composition, sediment slope, invertebrate densities, and shorebird abundance. Shorebird predation significantly affected invertebrate densities in only 1 of 6 experiments (Aberdeen Mouth). This site had higher sediment slope and slower water recedence than other study sites, resulting in concentration of shorebird predation on a smaller area of newly exposed sediment. Shorebird predation had the greatest impact on medium size class chironomid larvae at Aberdeen Mouth. Our results suggest that inland sites such as American Falls Reservoir represent viable shorebird habitat and may be managed to insure consistent prey availability. Drawdown rate, sediment slope, invertebrate densities, and shorebird abundance are all important factors influencing shorebird predation. Monitoring shorebird abundance and predation impact on invertebrate densities may help in manipulating drawdown rate to provide adequate shorebird prey. Management of inland sites for shorebird use may become more important in the future as human encroachment in coastal areas continues.},

abstract = {Migrant birds have tightly scheduled annual cycles consisting of several distinct life cycle (sub-)stages such as reproduction, migration, moult and overwintering, each of which have specific metabolic requirements (e.g., fattening during migration, protein build-up during moult). This study examines changes in fat and protein metabolism during the annual cycle of body mass and moult over 1.5 years in a captive flock of an arctic-breeding shorebird, the red knot Calidris canutus islandica. 2-5 h after food withdrawal, plasma uric acid levels were still decreasing and beta-hydroxy-butyrate levels were low, indicating prolonged catabolism of dietary protein, probably linked with a conversion into lipids. Such a late-resorptive state is achieved much earlier in passerines, but only after several days in penguins and, thus, seems to depend on meal size or mass-specific metabolic rate. Substages of body mass gain and high body mass were characterized by increased plasma triglyceride levels reflecting increased turnover of lipids, and low levels of the ketone body beta-hydroxy- butyrate, indicating that the bird is not short of glucose. The high uric acid levels during these substages indicated an increased breakdown of nutritional protein. During moult, plasma triglyceride levels were low, suggesting that lipids were less available than at other times of the year. It is concluded that plasma metabolite levels indicate the metabolic processes related to migratory fuelling and moult and the influence of exogeneous factors.},

abstract = {Several recent studies have considered the potential impact of climate change on regional wind intensity. However, previous wind speed studies in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) present conflicting results for wind speed trends in relation to climate drivers. This study analyzes the percentiles (50th, 75th, and 95th) of the strongly positively skewed distributions for PNW maximum daily wind speeds from 92 meteorological stations, and reveals different behaviors for average and extreme wind speeds. Considerably stronger winds are found at coastal locations compared with sites further inland. Extreme wind speeds at these coastal locations appear to follow an eight to nine-year cyclic pattern, while mainland sites have a small, linear downward wind speed trend. This finding of a behavioral dependence on location helps reconcile previous, apparently contradictory results and has important global implications for wind research and infrastructure planning, such as wind energy feasibility studies and air quality management activities.},

abstract = {Western Sandpipers, Calidris mauri, one of the world's most abundant shorebird species, migrate from winter sites in the southern USA and Central and South America to breeding grounds in Western Alaska and Eastern Siberia. We describe a dynamic state variable optimization model for these migrations, assuming that individual female sandpipers employ migration strategies that maximize their expected lifetime reproduction. The principal environmental factors assumed to affect migration decisions are variable wind speeds, site-specific predation risks, and the timing of food availability on the breeding grounds and at the two most northerly stopover sites. The model's predictions, which agree closely with data collected in the field, are most sensitive to changes in wind conditions during the flight phase, rather than foraging opportunities at stopover sites en route. We also show how the model can be used to assess potential impacts of habitat degradation on the fitness of this species.},

abstract = {Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) stop at staging areas during migration to replenish fat reserves that fuel long distance flights. We hypothesize that if sandpipers are minimizing time spent en route between wintering areas and breeding grounds, a negative correlation should exist between fat content upon arrival at a staging area and length of stay. We examined the relationship between these two variables at a spring staging area in coastal South Carolina using simple and multiple regression models. Length of stay was independent of estimated fat content at capture after controlling for date in the season. Birds with sufficient energy reserves for long distance flights were as likely to remain on the study area as lean birds. Date in the season showed more influence on stopover time than estimated fat mass at capture. Stopover time decreased with later date, suggesting an increase in the speed of migration as the season progressed. These results show that date is a critical variable influencing Semipalmated Sandpiper migration stopover strategy. Migrants appear to shift their migration priorities with respect to fat stores and stopover time as the season progresses.},

@article{Schmidt2001a,
abstract = {Incidental predation occurs when secondary prey items are encountered and subsequently consumed, not through directed search for such prey, but through their con- sequential encounter by a predator engaged in search for primary prey. We developed a mathematical model that examines the relationships between the abundance of primary prey, patch exploitation (i.e., quitting harvest rates), and the rate of incidental predation on secondary prey items. The model's predictions are dependent upon the spatial scale over which a forager integrates foraging costs and thus determines its quitting harvest rate (QHR). At local (i.e., foraging) spatial scales, we predicted that incidental predation should increase with local food abundance. Also at the foraging scale, local food abundance should not influence QHRs, but local predation risk (from higher trophic levels) should increase QHRs. Therefore, we predicted that incidental predation rates should be negatively correlated with QHRs. Over large (i.e., landscape) spatial scales, greater food abundance and predation risk increase QHRs, and we predicted that predation rates should vary inversely with QHR through two complementary mechanisms: foragers use a greater proportion of space and spend more time foraging as quitting harvest rates decrease. We experimentally tested the qualitative predictions of the theory in the field using artificial Veery (Catharus fuscescens) nests depredated by white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, across three spatial scales. We used the technique of giving-up densities to measure QHRs and to determine the scale at which mice integrate different foraging costs. In accord with our predictions, nest predation was positively influenced by the local abundance of food at the foraging scale, and local predation risk to mice and perhaps interference com- petition from chipmunks resulted in higher giving-up densities and lower nest predation. At the landscape scale, there was an inverse relationship between giving-up densities and nest predation, which was probably the result of large-scale differences in resource abun- dance between plots. Our study demonstrates how linking theoretical development to the use of empirical behavioral indicators can help determine the relevant ecological scales and processes necessary for understanding predator-prey interactions.},

The most obvious of which is an Arctic Ocean largely covered by an ice sheet in summer versus one largely devoid of such cover. Ecosystems under pressure typically shift between such alternative states in an abrupt, rather than smooth manner, with the level of forcing required for shifting this status termed threshold or tipping point. Loss of Arctic ice due to anthropogenic climate change is accelerating, with the extent of Arctic sea ice displaying increased variance at present, a leading indicator of the proximity of a possible tipping point. Reduced ice extent is expected, in turn, to trigger a number of additional tipping elements, physical, chemical, and biological, in motion, with potentially large impacts on the Arctic marine ecosystem.},

We tested the effects of diet type and diet lipid content on the predictive relationships between metabolites and body mass changes in three species of passerines in captivity. In addition, we tested whether measurement of plasma phospholipids improved predictions of mass change. Rate of mass change was positively related to triglycerides in a captive frugivore (Cedar Waxwing; Bombycilla cedrorum) and a granivore (White-crowned Sparrow; Zonotrichia leucophrys). B-OH butyrate was negatively and nonlinearly related to mass change in Cedar Waxwings and White-crowned Sparrows. Glycerol was negatively related to mass change in Cedar Waxwings but not in White-crowned Sparrows. Mass change was positively related to triglycerides and negatively related to B-OH butyrate in Yellow-rumped Warblers (Dendroica coronata). There was no effect of diet lipid content (9{\%} vs. 28{\%} dry mass) on these predictive relationships. Plasma phospholipids were positively related to mass change in White-crowned Sparrows, but negatively related to mass change in Yellow-rumped Warblers and not related to mass change in Cedar Waxwings. Measurement of phospholipids did not improve prediction of mass change by metabolite profiles. Nevertheless, plasma metabolite profiles are predictive of short-term mass changes in captive birds regardless of diet type or diet lipid content, and can provide valuable information on refueling performance in studies of stopover ecology.},

abstract = {Capsule Declines of upland waders were associated with habitat cover, forest edge exposure, grouse moor management intensity and crow abundance. Aims To explore whether changes in the abundance of five wader species in the uplands correlate with the three key hypotheses proposed for their declines. Methods Using data from repeat upland bird surveys, we examined at two spatial scales (region and plot) if population changes correlate with vegetation cover, forest edge exposure, grouse moor management intensity or crow abundance. Results For Northern Lapwings Vanellus vanellus and Eurasian Curlews Numenius arquata, there was an association between declines and broad-scale vegetation cover; declines being greatest on heather-dominated plots. Exposure to forest edge was associated with declines of European Golden Plovers Pluvialis apricaria and Common Snipe Galinago galinago at the plot scale, and of Northern Lapwings at the regional scale. More intensive grouse moor management was associated with lower declines in Northern Lapwings at both the plot and regional scale, but with greater declines in European Golden Plovers at the plot scale. Northern Lapwings also declined most on plots with the highest Carrion Crow Corvus corone abundance. Conclusion These analyses represent the first attempt to assess empirically the balance of evidence for different broad-scale land-use and habitat-related drivers of upland wader population declines, providing pointers to their respective roles in driving these declines.},

abstract = {The behavior of long-distance migrants during stopover is constrained by the need to quickly and safely replenish energetic reserves. Replenishing fuel stores at stopover sites requires adjusting to unfamiliar landscapes with little to no information about the distribution of resources. Despite their critical importance to the success of songbird migration, the effects of landscape composition and configuration on fuel deposition rates (FDR [g/d]), the currency of migration, has not been tested empirically. Our objectives were to understand the effects of heterogeneous landscapes on FDR of forest-dwelling songbirds during spring migration. The results of field experiments were used to parameterize a spatially explicit, individual-based model of forest songbird movement and resulting FDR. Further field experiments were used to validate the results from the individual-based model. In simulation experiments, we altered a Gulf South landscape in a factorial design to predict the effects of future patterns under different scenarios of land use change in which the abundance of high-quality hardwood habitat and the spatial aggregation of habitat varied. Simulated FDR decreased as the amount of hardwood in the landscape decreased from 41{\%} to 22{\%} to 12{\%}. Further, migrants that arrived in higher-quality habitat types gained more mass. Counter to our expectations, FDR was higher with lower spatial aggregation of habitat. Differences in refueling rates may be most influenced by whether or not an individual experiences an initial searching cost after landing in poor-quality habitat. Therefore, quickly locating habitat with sufficient food resources at each stopover may be the most important factor determining a successful migration. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the argument that hardwood forest cover is a primary determinant of the quality of a stopover site in this region. This study represents the first effort to empirically quantify FDRs based on the configuration of landscapes.},

abstract = {Different types of predators often elicit different antipredator responses in a common type of prey. Alternatively, some prey species may adopt a general response, which provides limited protection from many different types of predator. The Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata, is faced with a wide range of different predators throughout its range and is known to display varying levels of antipredator behavior depending on the predator assemblage. Pike cichlids, Crenicichla frenata, are regarded as the primary aquatic guppy predator in streams in the northern mountain range in Trinidad. As such, they are seen to be responsible for many of the differences in morphology, life history traits, and behavior between guppy populations from areas with few predators and those from areas with many pike cichlids. In this study we investigated how guppies responded when faced with different predator species using three common aquatic predators. We exposed shoals of ten guppies to one out of four treatments: no predator (control), pike cichlid, acara cichlid (Aequidens pulcher), and wolf fish (Hoplias malabaricus); and we made behavioral observations on both focal individuals and the shoal as a whole. Guppies showed significantly greater levels of predator inspection and shoaling behavior, foraged less, spent more time in the surface water, and stayed in significantly larger shoals when faced with pike cichlids than in other treatments. We discuss these results in the context of multiple predator effects.},

abstract = {We studied the relationships between the habitat use of migratory shorebirds and the spatial distributions of the Southwestern Atlantic Fiddler Crab Uca uruguayensis, polychaetes, sediment characteristics and tidal levels in the Rio de La Plata estuary, Argentina, where U. uruguayensis is one of the most important intertidal species. Crabs have a well-defined patchy distribution that is segregated spatially from that of polychaetes. Crab density on the surface varied across the tidal cycle, reaching maximum values during low tide. Polychaete density decreased with depth but showed no change through the tidal cycle; however, given that sediment penetrability did change during the same period, their availability to probing shorebirds is expected to change. Habitat use by shorebirds followed the spatial distribution of prey; shorebirds that foraged on polychaetes (White-rumped Sandpiper Calidris fuscicollis, Two-banded Plover Charadrius falklandicus and Hudsonian Godwit Limosa haemastica) focused their attention on the areas with the highest densities of polychaetes, whereas species that preyed mostly on crabs (Ruddy Turnstone Arenaria interpres, Whimbrel Numenius phaeopus and Grey Plover Pluvialis squatarola) predominantly used areas with crabs. This segregation occurred particularly during low tide, a period in which polychaetes became fully available. Results show that the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of mudflats in relation to the types and availability of prey has a strong effect on shorebird habitat use.},

semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) after leaving their
terrestrial natal sites, but the drivers of their use of these stopover
sites on the first ``hop{\{}''{\}} of fall migration are unknown. We
quantified sandpiper temporal distribution and abundance as related to
food resources at three river deltas during the beginning of their fall
migration (post-breeding period) to compare the habitat quality among
these deltas. We conducted population counts, sampled invertebrates, and
captured birds to collect blood samples from individuals for
triglyceride and stable isotope analyses to determine fattening rates
and diet. Patterns of sandpiper and invertebrate abundance were complex
and varied among deltas and within seasons. River deltas were used by
sandpipers from late July to late August, and peak sandpiper counts
ranged from 1000 to 4000 individuals, of which 98{\%} were hatch-year
semipalmated sandpipers. Isotopic signatures from blood plasma samples
indicated that birds switched from a diet of upland tundra to delta
invertebrate taxa as the migration season progressed, suggesting a
dependence on delta invertebrates. Despite differences in diet among
deltas, we found no differences in fattening rates of juvenile
sandpipers as indicated by triglyceride levels. The number of sandpipers
was positively associated with abundance of Amphipoda and Oligochaeta at
the Jago and Okpilak-Hulahula deltas; an isotopic mixing model indicated
that sandpipers consumed Amphipoda and Oligochaeta at Jago, mostly
Chironomidae at Okpilak-Hulahula and Spionidae at Canning. Regardless of
the difference in sandpiper diets at the Beaufort Sea deltas, their
similar fattening rates throughout the season indicate that all of these
stopover sites provide a critical food resource for hatch-year
sandpipers beginning their first migration.},

abstract = {Recent rapid climatic changes are associated with dramatic changes in phenology of plants and animals, with optimal timing of reproduction advancing considerably in the northern hemisphere. However, some species may not have advanced their timing of breeding sufficiently to continue reproducing optimally relative to the occurrence of peak food availability, thus becoming mismatched compared with their food sources. The degree of mismatch may differ among species, and species with greater mismatch may be characterized by declining populations. Here we relate changes in spring migration timing by 100 European bird species since 1960, considered as an index of the phenological response of bird species to recent climate change, to their population trends. Species that declined in the period 1990-2000 did not advance their spring migration, whereas those with stable or increasing populations advanced their migration considerably. On the other hand, population trends during 1970-1990 were predicted by breeding habitat type, northernmost breeding latitude, and winter range (with species of agricultural habitat, breeding at northern latitudes, and wintering in Africa showing an unfavorable conservation status), but not by change in migration timing. The association between population trend in 1990-2000 and change in migration phenology was not confounded by any of the previously identified predictors of population trends in birds, or by similarity in phenotype among taxa due to common descent. Our findings imply that ecological factors affecting population trends can change over time and suggest that ongoing climatic changes will increasingly threaten vulnerable migratory bird species, augmenting their extinction risk.},

abstract = {Correlations between transequatorial migratory bird routes and bipolar biogeographic disjunctions in bryophytes suggest that disjunctions between northern and southern high latitude regions may result from bird-mediated dispersal; supporting evidence is, however, exclusively circumstantial. Birds disperse plant units (diaspores) internally via ingestion (endozoochory) or externally by the attachment of diaspores to the body (ectozoochory). Endozoochory is known to be the primary means of bird-mediated dispersal for seeds and invertebrates at local, regional, and continental scales. Data supporting the role of bird-mediated endozoochory or ectozoochory in the long distance dispersal of bryophytes remain sparse, however, despite the large number of bryophytes displaying bipolar disjunctions. To determine if transequatorial migrant shorebirds may play a role in the ectozoochory of bryophyte diaspores, we developed a method for screening feathers of wild birds. We provide the first evidence of microscopic bryophyte diaspores, as well as those from non-bryophyte lineages, embedded in the plumage of long distance transequatorial migrant birds captured in their arctic breeding grounds. The number of diaspores recovered suggests that entire migratory populations may be departing their northern breeding grounds laden with potentially viable plant parts and that they could thereby play significant roles in bipolar range expansions of lineages previously ignored in the migrant bird dispersal literature.},

abstract = {Understanding animal movements is fundamental to ecology and conservation, yet direct measurement of movements of birds is both challenging and costly. Raptor behavior and demography are especially difficult to monitor, but models of movement can provide information toward this goal. The golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) in eastern North America is an apex predator of regional conservation concern, and little is known about its population ecology, movements, or behavior. We designed an agent-based model to simulate autumn migration of eagles in Pennsylvania, USA. Inputs to the model included information on regional topography, known flight behaviors (i.e. slope-soaring and thermal-soaring and gliding), estimated uplift, and a principal axis of migration. In total, we modeled 6094 flight routes, averaging 2191 (+/- 1281; +/- SD; range: 3-5373) moves. Simulations were spatially comparable to historic flight route data collected via telemetry and generally followed topography that provided uplift. In our model, orographic uplift available to migrant eagles was stronger and more frequent than thermal uplift, and uplift forms were not correlated with one another (r=-0.145). Modeled golden eagle migration in autumn follows a narrow-front pattern as individuals are concentrated in areas that produce orographic uplift. Simulated flights were more concentrated on days when historic counts of golden eagles were high at monitoring sites. In contrast, simulations were more dispersed on days when fewer actual eagles were recorded. We used output from our simulations to select new sites that could be used for monitoring migratory raptors. Relatively large numbers of golden eagles were observed at these sites, thus validating performance of our model. This work identifies a novel, cost-effective method for modeling migration patterns of and furthering conservation goals for a rare, low-density raptor species. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Genetically based variation in coloration occurs in populations of many organisms belonging to various taxa, including birds, mammals, frogs, molluscs, insects and plants. Colour polymorphism has evolved in raptors more often than in any other group of birds, suggesting that predator-prey relationships was a driving evolutionary force. Individuals displaying a new invading colour morph may enjoy an initial foraging advantage because prey have difficulties in learning the colour of a rare morph (apostatic selection), or because morphs provide alternative foraging benefits allowing differently coloured individuals to exploit distinct food niches (disruptive selection). Plumage polymorphism should therefore have evolved in species that prey upon animals having the physiological ability to distinguish between differently coloured predators but also to flee once a predator has been detected. From this assumption, we can predict that closely related polymorphic and monomorphic species prey upon different animals. They may also differ in morphology, because foraging upon different prey may require different foraging modes, and in turn different morphological structures. We tested these two predictions in a comparative study of raptors. As expected, polymorphic and monomorphic species had a different diet, and there was a difference in wing length between polymorphic and monomorphic species within two genera (Buteo and Accipiter). Across all raptors for which phyl ogenetic relationships are known, polymorphic species preyed more often upon mammals than did monomorphic ones. These two types of raptor did not differ in the frequency of birds, insects and reptiles in their diets. We discuss these results in the light of the hypothesis that predator-prey relationships played a role in the evolution of colour polymorphism. (C) 2004 The Linnean Society of London.},

@article{Faraway2002,
abstract = {There are many books on regression and analysis of variance. These books expect different levels of preparedness and place different emphases on the material. This book is not introductory. It presumes some knowledge of basic statistical theory and practice. Students are expected to know the essentials of statistical inference like estimation, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. A basic knowledge of data analysis is presumed. Some linear algebra and calculus is also required. The emphasis of this text is on the practice of regression and analysis of variance. The objective is to learn what methods are available and more importantly, when they should be applied. Many examples are presented to clarify the use of the techniques and to demonstrate what conclusions can be made. There is relatively less emphasis on mathematical theory, partly because some prior knowledge is assumed and partly because the issues are better tackled elsewhere. Theory is important because it guides the approach we take. I take a wider view of statistical theory. It is not just the formal theorems. Qualitative statistical concepts are just as important in Statistics because these enable us to actually do it rather than just talk about it. These qualitative principles are harder to learn because they are difficult to state precisely but they guide the successful experienced Statistician. Data analysis cannot be learnt without actually doing it. This means using a statistical computing package. There is a wide choice of such packages. They are designed for different audiences and have different strengths and weaknesses. I have chosen to use R (ref. Ihaka and Gentleman (1996)). Why do I use R The are several reasons. 1. Versatility. R is a also a programming language, so I am not limited by the procedures that are preprogrammed by a package. It is relatively easy to program new methods in R . 2. Interactivity. Data analysis is inherently interactive. Some older statistical packages were designed when computing was more expensive and batch processing of computations was the norm. Despite improvements in hardware, the old batch processing paradigm lives on in their use. R does one thing at a time, allowing us to make changes on the basis of what we see during the analysis. 3. R is based on S from which the commercial package S-plus is derived. R itself is open-source software and may be freely redistributed. Linux, Macintosh, Windows and other UNIX versions are maintained and can be obtained from the R-project at www.r-project.org. R is mostly compatible with S-plus meaning that S-plus could easily be used for the examples given in this book. 4. Popularity. SAS is the most common statistics package in general but R or S is most popular with researchers in Statistics. A look at common Statistical journals confirms this popularity. R is also popular for quantitative applications in Finance. The greatest disadvantage of R is that it is not so easy to learn. Some investment of effort is required before productivity gains will be realized. This book is not an introduction to R. There is a short introduction in the Appendix but readers are referred to the R-project web site at www.r-project.org where you can find introductory documentation and information about books on R . I have intentionally included in the text all the commands used to produce the output seen in this book. This means that you can reproduce these analyses and experiment with changes and variations before fully understanding R . The reader may choose to start working through this text before learning R and pick it up as you go. The web site for this book is at where data de- scribed in this book appears. Updates will appear there also. Thanks to the builders of R without whom this book would not have been possible.},

abstract = {We re-assessed the population size and trend of 52 species and 75 taxa of shorebirds that occur in North America by reviewing published papers, soliciting unpublished data, and seeking the opinions of experts. New infor- mation resulted in changing population estimates for 35 of the 71 taxa that could be compared directly to the estimates published in 2006; from this comparison, 28 estimates increased and seven decreased. Almost all of the increases (88{\%}) were the result of more comprehensive surveys being conducted or re-analyses of existing data rather than actual increases in numbers. Retaining the previous estimate was almost always due to a lack of new information. Recent trend analysis indicates that many shorebird populations have stabilized in recent years after large declines during the early 1980s and mid-1990s. Although many shorebird populations listed as threatened or endangered by the U.S. and Canadian governments have increasing population trends, none have reached recovery targets. Information on population trends remains virtually unknown for 25{\%} of the shorebirds occurring in North America, and surveys are needed to determine the state of these populations.},

@article{Ward2005,
abstract = {Abstract We describe the importance of key habitats used by four nesting populations of nearctic brant (Branta bernicla) and discuss the potential relationship between changes in these habitats and population dynamics of brant. Nearctic brant, in contrast to most geese, rely on marine habitats and native intertidal plants during the non-breeding season, particularly the seagrass, Zostera, and the macroalgae, Ulva. Atlantic and Eastern High Arctic brant have experienced the greatest degradation of their winter habitats (northeastern United States and Ireland, respectively) and have also shown the most plasticity in feeding behavior. Black and Western High Arctic brant of the Pacific Flyway are the most dependent on Zostera, and are undergoing a shift in winter distribution that is likely related to climate change and its associated effects on Zostera dynamics. Variation in breeding propensity of Black Brant associated with winter location and climate strongly suggests that food abundance on the wintering grounds directly affects reproductive performance in these geese. In summer, salt marshes, especially those containing Carex and Puccinellia, are key habitats for raising young, while lake shorelines with fine freshwater grasses and sedges are important for molting birds. Availability and abundance of salt marshes has a direct effect on growth and recruitment of goslings and ultimately, plays an important role in regulating size of local brant populations.},

Plant material displayed a wide range of delta(13)C values (from -12 to -34 parts per thousand), with relatively distinct values among producer groups (Chlorophyce ae, Fucales, Laminariales, Rhodophyce ae seagrasses, plankton), and among strata of intertidal zonation. Animal delta(13)C range was narrower (-15 to -22 parts per thousand), and in general, values differed more between than within phyla or classes, according to the staple diet of organisms. A good correlation between the delta(13)C values of food and consumers was noted, together with a slight C-13-enrichment (approximate to 1 parts per thousand) with increasing trophic levels from suspension-feeders to predators.},

abstract = {Shorebirds encounter variable and unpredictable food resources at stopover sites during migration through interior North America. We studied foraging strategies and niche dynamics of American Avocets (Recurvirostra americana), Long-billed Dowitchers (Limnodromus scolopaceus), Least Sandpipers (Calidris minutilla), and Western Sandpipers (C. mauri) at stopover sites in 60 playa lakes of the southern Great Plains. Those species were selected because they are common in our study area during migration and represent a wide range of morphological classes. Overall foraging niches (linear combination of diet diversity, prey size, foraging-method diversity, and water depth) of avocets and dowitchers were segregated from each other and from Least and Western sandpipers. Overall foraging niches of Least and Western sandpipers were similar. Examination of single niche dimensions showed that avocets and dowitchers consumed larger prey and foraged in deeper water than did Least and Western sandpipers. Within the range of prey sizes consumed by the four individual species, all species selected small prey (0.1-5.0 mm). Preference of relatively small prey by avocets and dowitchers was likely a function of small prey being more abundant in playas than large prey ({\textgreater}10 mm). However, selection of small prey by Least and Western sandpipers was likely a function of lower handling costs associated with small prey. Abundance of prey items in diets of each species was not correlated with nutritional and energetic quality of prey items, but abundance of prey in the diet was correlated with abundance of prey in playa lakes. That suggests that all four shorebird species adopt an opportunistic foraging strategy during migration. Use of opportunism is likely critical for shorebirds to continue migration and arrive on breeding grounds in good condition.},

abstract = {Dataset on departure fuel loads, stopover length and fuel deposition rate of the European robins Erithacus rubecula during their migration in the Baltic area is presented. We test these empirical data against the predictions of an optimal migration model assuming that robins minimize time spent on migration, and that fuel deposition rate varies stochastically. The latter assumption sets this model apart from the alternative ones and makes it more realistic. In particular, it is applicable in frequently observed situations when fuel deposition rate is negative. Our model assumes stochastic variation of the fuel deposition rate at sites along the migratory rout and thus is applicable when negative values of fuel deposition rate are recorded. The model predicts the relationship between fuel deposition rate and departure fuel load rather well. The agreement between the observed and the predicted values of optimal stopover duration is much poorer. Predictions of optimal migration theory are known to be dependent on the form of flight equation chosen. Our model fits the data best when the costs of transport are low. This supports the idea that transport costs of fuel stores may be low, especially when fuel stores are modest.},

abstract = {The presence of top predators can affect prey behaviour, morphology and life history, and thereby can produce indirect population consequences greater and further reaching than direct depredation would have alone. Raptor species in the Americas are recovering since restrictions on the use of dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and the implementation of conservation measures, in effect constituting a hemisphere-wide predator-reintroduction experiment, and profound effects on populations of their prey are to be expected. Here, we document changes in the behaviour of western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) at migratory stopover sites over two decades. Since 1985, migratory body mass and stopover durations of western sandpipers have fallen steadily at some stopovers in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia. Comparisons between years, sites and seasons strongly implicate increasing danger from the recovery of peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) as a causal factor. A decade-long ongoing steep decline in sandpiper numbers censused on our study site is explained entirely by the shortening stopover duration, rather than fewer individuals using the site. Such behavioural changes are probably general among migratory shorebird species, and may be contributing to the widespread census declines reported in North America.},

abstract = {It is theoretically and empirically well established that body mass variation in small birds reflects a trade-off between starvation risk and predation risk. This occurs because carrying increased fat reserves reduces starvation risk but also results in a higher predation risk due to reduced escape flight performance and/or the increased foraging exposure needed to maintain a higher body mass. In principle, therefore, the theory of mass-dependent predation risk could be used to understand how a bird perceives and responds to the risks in its environment, because its mass will reflect the predictability of foraging opportunities and predation risk. Mass in birds may then provide a relatively straightforward way of assessing the foraging environment of birds and so the potential conservation problems a species faces. This study tests, for the first time for any species, how body mass changes in response to changing starvation risk, changing predation risk and changing population status. Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris mass varies as predicted by starvation-predation risk trade-off theory: mass is lower when foraging conditions are more favourable and when predation risk is increased. The populations that are declining the most strongly have higher mass, which is most likely indicative of a poor foraging environment, leading to lower relative survival. The results suggest that increased mass in Starlings, and possibly in other species, may provide an indication of the poor quality of the foraging environment and/or rapidly declining populations},

This includes the understanding of our environment, for intellectual, economical, social, and political reasons, and as a major source of innovation. We contend that we should focus less on short-term, objective-driven research and more on creativity and exploratory analyses, quantitatively estimate the benefits of fundamental research for society, and better explain the nature and importance of fundamental ecology to students, politicians, decision makers, and the general public. Our perspective and underlying arguments should also apply to evolutionary biology and to many of the other biological and physical sciences.},

abstract = {Colonization of a recreated area of intertidal land by marine invertebrates and their bird predators was studied from April 1993 to August 1997, The most important food of large shorebirds, the ragworm Nereis diversicolor, did not reappear until late summer 1995 and did not become abundant until the following autumn. Annual attempts at colonization by the crustacean Corophium volutator, the main food of several small shorebird species, failed until summer 1996 when animals survived through the subsequent winter for the first time. Colonization by the mud-snail Hydrobia ulvae took place a year after flooding of the site, but densities in 1997,were still well below those found elsewhere on the adjacent estuary. The delay in successful colonization by Nereis and Corophium may be attributable in part to the compaction of the intertidal muds caused by the earthmoving equipment used to contour the site. The slow increase in Hydrobia density may be a consequence of low organic content of the mud. Bird use is concentrated chiefly during the hours when the adjacent estuarine mudflats (with unrestricted tidal flow) are covered by the tide, since the new site then provides a supplementary feeding area, Peak daytime usage occurs during the migratory passage periods when birds need to feed for longer periods than usual, in order to refuel for their migrations; high usage is also anticipated in cold winters, On this evidence, creation of intertidal areas in mitigation for any lost nearby to industrial or other development should take place at least three years before the losses, in order to make the new areas profitable for feeding waterfowl.

abstract = {The purpose of this work was to evaluate the contribution of guano by piscivorous birds and their effect on soft bottom benthic species during the summer of 1996 and 1997 in a SW Atlantic coastal lagoon (Mar Chiquita, 37 degrees 45'S, 57 degrees 26'W). The abundance of piscivorous seabirds (mainly black skimmers, South American tern, snowy-crowned tern, common tern) in sandbars near the mouth of the lagoon oscillated between 552 (SE = 373) in 1996 and 1686 (SE = 935) individuals in 1997. In this area, these birds produce 0.27 g of guano m(-2) d(-1). Benthic samples showed that bird resting areas have a significantly larger density of macrofauna (e.g., polychaetes and meiofauna nematodes) than areas not used by birds. Experimental addition of guano in areas without birds [three treatments: (1) no addition, without guano, (2) low addition of guano, 0.23 g m(-2) d(-1), and (3) high addition, 0.57 g m(-2) d(-1)] showed no significant changes in the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter. Nematodes increased in abundance when the addition of guano increased, but ostracods and polychaetes showed no mean effect. The SW Atlantic intertidal burrowing crab Chasmagnathus granulata decreased the amount of sediment removed. All observations and experiments presented here showed that the input of guano by piscivorous seabirds affect abundance and behavior of several benthic species. This evidence also supports the hypothesis that the structure of estuarine benthic communities in areas used by piscivorous seabirds can be controlled through the input of nutrients (i.e., a "bottom up" process).},

abstract = {During their annual mid- to late-summer southward migration, Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) feed intensively on the amphipod Corophium volutator on intertidal mudflats in the Bay of Fundy. Corophium, in turn, feed on diatoms and bacteria. Using a series of bird exclosures and fertilizer addition, we examined top-down and bottom-up effects, and investigated the presence of a trophic cascade in the mudflat community during the period when birds are abundant. Although both top-down and bottom-up forces were present in this system, neither transmitted beyond a single trophic link. Predation by shorebirds, which may be less size-selective than previously thought, reduced Corophium abundance in control plots by approximately 80{\%} relative to exclosures, but most other species were unaffected. Shorebird predation did not result in an increase in diatom abundance, as predicted under the trophic cascade hypothesis. Fertilizer increased diatom abundance, but had no effect on Corophium abundance or bird predation, and little effect on other mudflat invertebrates. The only indirect effect observed was on mud snails (Ilyanassa obsoleta), which, by rapidly responding to changes in diatom abundance, compensated for both bird exclusion and fertilizer addition, and prevented the trophic cascade. This population response by snails, possibly stemming from competition with Corophium, probably contributed to the stability of the community. Our results provide an example of short-term compensation in a simple intertidal community, and highlight the importance of considering direct and indirect effects in community ecological studies. We conclude that while compensatory interactions that block trophic cascades may be more common in more complex ecosystems, they are not restricted to them.},

@article{Goss-Custard2015,
abstract = {As field determinations take much effort, it would be useful to be able to predict easily the coefficients describing the functional response of free-living predators, the function relating food intake rate to the abundance of food organisms in the environment. As a means easily to parameterise an individual-based model of shorebird Charadriiformes populations, we attempted this for shorebirds eating macro-invertebrates. Intake rate is measured as the ash-free dry mass (AFDM) per second of active foraging; i.e. excluding time spent on digestive pauses and other activities, such as preening. The present and previous studies show that the general shape of the functional response in shorebirds eating approximately the same size of prey across the full range of prey density is a decelerating rise to a plateau, thus approximating the Holling type 11 ('disc equation') formulation. But field studies confirmed that the asymptote was not set by handling time, as assumed by the disc equation, because only about half the foraging time was spent in successfully or unsuccessfully attacking and handling prey, the rest being devoted to searching. A review of 30 functional responses showed that intake rate in free-living shorebirds varied independently of prey density over a wide range, with the asymptote being reached at very low prey densities ({\textless} 150/m(-2)). Accordingly, most of the many studies of shorebird intake rate have probably been conducted at or near the asymptote of the functional response, suggesting that equations that predict intake rate should also predict the asymptote. A multivariate analysis of 468 'spot' estimates of intake rates from 26 shorebirds identified ten variables, representing prey and shorebird characteristics, that accounted for 81 {\%} of the variance in logarithm-transformed intake rate. But four-variables accounted for almost as much (77.3 {\%}), these being bird size, prey size, whether the bird was an oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus eating mussels Mytilus edulis, or breeding. The four variable equation under-predicted, on average, the observed 30 estimates of the asymptote by 11.6{\%}, but this discrepancy was reduced to 0.2{\%} when two suspect estimates from one early study in the 1960s were removed. The equation therefore predicted the observed asymptote very successfully in 93 {\%} of cases. We conclude that the asymptote can be reliably predicted from just four easily measured variables. Indeed, if the birds are not breeding and are not oystercatchers eating mussels, reliable predictions can be obtained using just two variables, bird and prey sizes. A multivariate analysis of 23 estimates of the half-asymptote constant suggested they were smaller when prey were small but greater when the birds were large, especially in oystercatchers. The resulting equation could be used to predict the half-asymptote constant, but its predictive power has yet to be tested. As well as predicting the asymptote of the functional response, the equations will enable research workers engaged in many areas of shorebird ecology and behaviour to estimate intake rate without the need for conventional time-consuming field studies, including species for which it has not yet proved possible to measure intake rate in the field.},

abstract = {Climate change within the UK will affect winter starvation risk because higher temperatures reduce energy budgets and are likely to increase the quality of the foraging environment. Mass regulation in birds is a consequence of the starvation-predation risk trade-off: decreasing starvation risk because of climate change should decrease mass, but this will be countered by the effects of predation risk, because high predation risk has a negative effect on mass when foraging conditions are poor and a positive effect on mass when foraging conditions are good. We tested whether mass regulation in great tits (Parus major) across the UK was related to temporal changes in starvation risk (winter temperature 1995-2005) and spatial changes in predation risk (sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus abundance). As predicted, great tits carried less mass during later, warmer, winters, demonstrating that starvation risk overall has decreased. Also, the effects of predation risk interacted with the effects of temperature (as an index of foraging conditions), so that in colder winters higher sparrowhawk abundance led to lower mass, whereas in warmer, later, winters higher sparrowhawk abundance led to higher mass. Mass regulation in a small bird species may therefore provide an index of how environmental change is affecting the foraging environment.},

We used random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses to search for markers specific to difficult-to-differentiate shorebird species (e.g. long-billed dowitcher Limnodromus scolopaceus and short-billed dowitcher L. griseus) as well as geographically distinct breeding populations of Hudsonian godwits Limosa haemastica, red-necked phalaropes Phalaropus lobatus, semipalmated plovers Charadrius semipalmatus, dunlin Calidris alpina, pectoral sandpipers C. melanotos, semipalmated sandpipers C. pusilla and western sandpipers C. mauri. Markers clearly differentiated all shorebird species. Estimates of population differentiation varied greatly among species (F-ST = 0.095-0.685) and correlated with interspecific variation in philopatry and geographical separation of breeding populations. We assigned individuals to putative breeding locales with greater certainty in well-differentiated species than in poorly differentiated species. Our findings indicate specific phylogeographical structure varies among species, which has strong implications for conservation of habitats within migratory corridors. We suggest that RAPDs are useful in identifying geographical populations of migratory species and that molecular markers should be considered for tracking migratory birds throughout the annual cycle.},

abstract = {Aim The identification of sources of beta diversity, the turnover component of diversity, is important to understand the generation of diversity, and thus central to biodiversity and biogeography. We investigated the relative importance of environmental filtering and dispersal-based factors affecting beta diversity in benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages at different spatial scales in an estuary, and tested the hypothesis that species with a long pelagic larval life are more dispersive and have lower beta diversity than species with direct benthic development. Location Denmark, the North SeaBaltic Sea transition area. Methods Additive partitioning of alpha diversity computed with multiplicative beta diversity was performed on species abundance of 279 species using 330 samples from 110 sites at four hierarchically arranged spatial scales where the largest scale comprised regions ({\textgreater}100km) with different salinity regimes, each subdivided into two sediment habitats. Pairwise beta diversity between sites was examined across environmental gradients and by distance decay functions within areas with more homogeneous environments. Results Beta diversity was high among regions and among sites within habitats, but low between habitats. Abundanceoccupancy relationships suggested that species with a long pelagic life were more dispersive than species with direct benthic development. Beta between sites in the two dispersal groups changed at the same rate with salinity difference among regions, but showed different rates of geographical distance decay among sites within regions. Average beta diversity and decay rates were higher, and halving distances were shorter for the less dispersive species. Main conclusions Different beta diversity of species groups with different propagule vagility suggest that beta diversity is negatively related to dispersivity. With the environmental filtering factor salinity as the overriding factor at the regional scale ({\textgreater}100km), and restrictions on dispersal affecting beta diversity at smaller scales, results show that the relative importance of niche-based and dispersal-based factors changes with scale.},

We found sex differences in departure time of radio-marked birds from the banding site, their arrival time at the Copper River Delta, Alaska (our most frequently used stopover site), and in the likelihood that a Stopover was used. Our data suggest that by mid to late April, migration timing becomes more compressed and sex differences are less pronounced and harder to detect.},

We measured the total metabolic power input of a long-distance migrant, the red knot (Calidris canutus), flying for 6 to 10 h in a wind tunnel, using the doubly labelled water technique. Here we show that total metabolic power input increased with fuel load, but proportionally less than the predicted mechanical power output from the flight muscles. The most likely explanation is that the efficiency with which metabolic power input is converted into mechanical output by the flight muscles increases with fuel load. This will influence current models of bird flight and bird migration. It may also help to explain why some shorebirds, despite the high metabolic power input required to fly, routinely make nonstop flights of 4,000 km longer.},

abstract = {Abstract The relationship between body mass and reactions speed in response to a predatory threat is poorly understood. Theory predicts that different vigilance patterns are optimal for the detection of different predator types. We suggest that birds of different individual state might also differ in their speed of response dependent upon predator type. We used laboratory trials of wild caught chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs) to determine how between individual differences in chaffinch behaviour and state correlate with latency to react to a ground predator model (domestic cat), thus providing a comparison with previous work in the same model system using aerial predator models. In experiment 1, we observed chaffinch responses to a moving cat model, simulating a stalking predator. In experiment 2, we used a camouflaged cat model simulating an ambush predator. Both experiments show evidence suggesting heavier individuals (which previous literature has linked to impaired flight performance) responded more quickly to the model cat. Heavier individuals also had shorter interscan intervals. In contrast to a previous study, both experiments found individuals with a higher intake rate were not faster at responding to the cat model. In addition, individuals in experiment 1 that head turned more while scanning were slower to respond to the stalking cat model. Our work suggests that although heavier individuals may have impaired escape performance they appear to show behavioural compensation by allocating more attention to anti-predator behaviour and by modifying their interscan intervals, resulting in faster response times to a ground predator. We suggest more experiments investigating response time to different predatory types and explicitly manipulating state to elucidate cause and effect},

abstract = {Estimating the abundance of migratory species is difficult because sources of variability differ substantially among species and populations. Recently developed state-space models address this variability issue by directly modeling both environmental and measurement error, although their efficacy in detecting declines is relatively untested for empirical data. We applied state-space modeling, generalized least squares (with autoregression error structure), and standard linear regression to data on abundance of wetland birds (shorebirds and terns) at Moreton Bay in southeast Queensland, Australia. There are internationally significant numbers of 8 species of waterbirds in the bay, and it is a major terminus of the large East Asian-Australasian Flyway. In our analyses, we considered 22 migrant and 8 resident species. State-space models identified abundances of 7 species of migrants as significantly declining and abundance of one species as significantly increasing. Declines in migrant abundance over 15 years were 43-79{\%}. Generalized least squares with an autoregressive error structure showed abundance changes in 11 species, and standard linear regression showed abundance changes in 15 species. The higher power of the regression models meant they detected more declines, but they also were associated with a higher rate of false detections. If the declines in Moreton Bay are consistent with trends from other sites across the flyway as a whole, then a large number of species are in significant decline.},

abstract = {Nonlinear regression methods often rely on the assumption that the nonlinear mean function can be approximated by a linear function locally. This linear approximation may or may not be used in the estimation algorithm (e.g., the Gauss-Newton algorithm), but more importantly it is often used to obtain standard errors, confidence intervals, and t-tests, all of which will depend on how good the approximation is. The quality of the linear approximation can be summarised by means of two features of the model referred to as intrinsic curvature and parameter effects curvature. We will not provide rigorous definitions here. More details can be found in Bates and Watts (1988, Chapter 7). The two curvature measures reflect different aspects of the linear approximation: (1) The planar assumption ensures that it is possible to approximate the nonlinear mean function at a given point using a tangent plane. (2) The uniform coordinate assumption means that a linear coordinate system is imposed on the approximating tangent plane. Intrinsic curvature is related to the planar assumption, and it depends on the dataset considered and the mean function but not on the parameterisation used in the mean function. Parameter effects curvature is related to the uniform coordinate assumption, and it depends on all aspects of the model, including the parameterisation. Large values of these two curvature measures indicate a poor linear approximation. The function rms.curv() in the package MASS can be used to calculate the two measures for a given nls() model fit (Venables and Ripley, 2002b).},

abstract = {Understanding the population dynamics of migratory animals and predicting the consequences of environmental change requires knowing how populations are spatially connected between different periods of the annual cycle. We used stable isotopes to examine patterns of migratory connectivity across the range of the western sandpiper Calidris mauri. First, we developed a winter isotope basemap from stable-hydrogen (dD), -carbon (d13C), and -nitrogen (d15N) isotopes of feathers grown in wintering areas. dD and d15N values from wintering individuals varied with the latitude and longitude of capture location, while d13C varied with longitude only. We then tested the ability of the basemap to assign known-origin individuals. Sixty percent of wintering individuals were correctly assigned to their region of origin out of seven possible regions. Finally, we estimated the winter origins of breeding and migrant individuals and compared the resulting empirical distribution against the distribution that would be expected based on patterns of winter relative abundance. For breeding birds, the distribution of winter origins differed from expected only among males in the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta and Nome, Alaska. Males in the Y-K Delta originated overwhelmingly from western Mexico, while in Nome, there were fewer males from western North America and more from the Baja Peninsula than expected. An unexpectedly high proportion of migrants captured at a stopover site in the interior United States originated from eastern and southern wintering areas, while none originated from western North America. In general, we document substantial mixing between the breeding and wintering populations of both sexes, which will buffer the global population of western sandpipers from the effects of local habitat loss on both breeding and wintering grounds.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple reconstructive procedures are common for the reconstruction of complex facial deformities of skin, soft tissues, bony structures, and functional subunits, such as the nose, lips, and eyelids. However, the results have been unsatisfactory. An innovative approach entailing a single surgical procedure of face allograft transplantation is a viable alternative and gives improved results. METHODS: On Dec 9, 2008, a 45-year-old woman with a history of severe midface trauma underwent near-total face transplantation in which 80{\%} of her face was replaced with a tailored composite tissue allograft. We addressed issues of immunosuppressive therapy, psychological and ethical outcomes, and re-integration of the patient into society. FINDINGS: After the operation, the patient did well physically and psychologically, and tolerated immunosuppression without any major complication. Routine biopsy on day 47 after transplantation showed rejection of graft mucosa; however, a single bolus of corticosteroids reversed rejection. During the first 3 weeks after transplantation, the patient accepted her new face; 6 months after surgery, the functional outcome has been excellent. In contrast to her status before transplantation, the patient can now breathe through her nose, smell, taste, speak intelligibly, eat solid foods, and drink from a cup. INTERPRETATION: We show the feasibility of reconstruction of severely disfigured patients in a single surgical procedure using composite face allotransplantation. Therefore, this should be taken in consideration as an early option for severely disfigured patients. FUNDING: None.},

The I-T approaches can replace the usual t tests and ANOVA tables that are so inferentially limited, but still commonly used. The I-T methods are easy to compute and understand and provide formal measures of the strength of evidence for both the null and alternative hypotheses, given the data. We give an example to highlight the importance of deriving alternative hypotheses and representing these as probability models. Fifteen technical issues are addressed to clarify various points that have appeared incorrectly in the recent literature. We offer several remarks regarding the future of empirical science and data analysis under an I-T framework.},

@article{Schmaljohann2017b,
abstract = {Background: Predicting the consequences of continuing anthropogenic changes in the environment for migratory behaviours such as phenology remains a major challenge. Predictions remain particularly difficult, because our knowledge is based on studies from single-snapshot observations at specific stopover sites along birds' migration routes. However, a general understanding on how birds react to prevailing environmental conditions, e.g. their 'phenotypic reaction norm', throughout the annual cycle and along their entire migration routes is required to fully understand how migratory birds respond to rapid environmental change. Results: Here, we provide direct evidence that northern wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) from a breeding population in Alaska adjusted their probability to resume migration as well as the distance covered per night, i.e. travel speed, to large-scale environmental conditions experienced along their 15,000 km migratory route on both northwards and southwards migrations. These adjustments were found to be flexible in space and time. At the beginning of autumn migration, northern wheatears showed high departure probabilities and high travel speeds at low surface air temperatures, while far away from Alaska both traits decreased with increasing air temperatures. In spring, northern wheatears increasingly exploited flow assistance with season, which is likely a behavioural adjustment to speed up migration by increasing the distance travelled per night. Furthermore, the variation in total stopover duration but not in travel speed had a significant effect on the total speed of migration, indicating the prime importance of total stopover duration in the overall phenology of bird migration. Conclusion: Northern wheatears from Alaska provide evidence that the phenotypic reaction norm to a set of environmental conditions cannot be generalized to universal and persistent behavioural reaction pattern across entire migratory pathways. This highlights the importance of full annual-cycle studies on migratory birds to better understand their response to the environment. Understanding the mechanisms behind phenotypic plasticity during migration is particularly important in the assessment of whether birds can keep pace with the potentially increasing phenological mismatches observed on the breeding grounds.},

abstract = {In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, action potentials generated in the axon back-propagate in a decremental fashion into the dendritic tree where they affect synaptic integration and synaptic plasticity. The amplitude of back-propagating action potentials (b-APs) is controlled by various biological factors, including membrane potential (Vm). We report that, at any dendritic location (x), the transition from weak (small-amplitude b-APs) to strong (large-amplitude b-APs) back-propagation occurs when Vm crosses a threshold potential, x. When Vm {\textgreater} x, back-propagation is strong (mostly active). Conversely, when Vm {\textless} x, back-propagation is weak (mostly passive). x varies linearly with the distance (x) from the soma. Close to the soma, x resting membrane potential (RMP) and a strong hyperpolarization of the membrane is necessary to switch back-propagation from strong to weak. In the distal dendrites, x RMP and a strong depolarization is necessary to switch back-propagation from weak to strong. At approximately 260 micrometer from the soma, 260 approximately RMP, suggesting that in this dendritic region back-propagation starts to switch from strong to weak. x depends on the availability or state of Na+ and K+ channels. Partial blockade or phosphorylation of K+ channels decreases x and thereby increases the portion of the dendritic tree experiencing strong back-propagation. Partial blockade or inactivation of Na+ channels has the opposite effect. We conclude that x is a parameter that captures the onset of the transition from weak to strong back-propagation. Its modification may alter dendritic function under physiological and pathological conditions by changing how far large action potentials back-propagate in the dendritic tree.},

@article{Brown2013,
abstract = {Summary An estimated 80 million birds are killed by colliding with vehicles on U. S. roads each year [1], and millions more die annually in Europe [2] and elsewhere. Losses to vehicles are a serious problem for which various changes in roadway design and maintenance have been proposed [3]. Yet, given the magnitude of the mortality reported for some species [4], we might expect natural selection to favor individuals that either learn to avoid cars or that have other traits making them less likely to collide with vehicles. If so, the frequency of road kill should decline over time. No information is available for any species on whether the extent of road-associated mortality has changed [2]. During a 30-year study on social behavior and coloniality of cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) in southwestern Nebraska, we found that the frequency of road-killed swallows declined sharply over the 30 years following the birds' occupancy of roadside nesting sites and that birds killed on roads had longer wings than the population at large.},

abstract = {The diet and feeding methods of Avocets Recurvirostra avosetta using the most common feeding strategy (Normal Feeding Strategy) on emerged intertidal areas in the Tagus estuary, Portugal, were studied during two winters. Avocets using the Normal Feeding Strategy fed non-selectively in the top 20 mm of sediment, ingesting prey bigger than a minimum threshold dimension of around 1.5 mm. Some mud was also ingested whilst feeding. Prey were captured by the mechanical action of the bill, and the estimated number of items captured per sweep was quite high (mean = 10.9 worms). Most of the biomass ingested by Avocets consisted of oligochaetes, spionid worms, Capitella capitata and small ragworms Nereis diversicolor. The estimated intake rate of Avocets suggested that the energy ingested during daylight hours did not represent a significant percentage of the daily requirements. Thus, feeding on emerged intertidal areas is probably a secondary component of their daily gross food intake, unless night feeding yields higher intake rates due to increased prey availability.},

abstract = {Nest-habitat selection in colonial species has rarely been assessed at multiple spatial scales to evaluate its fitness consequences. Management for the federally endangered U.S. Interior population of Least Terns (Sternula antillarum) has focused on maintenance of breeding habitats, including mechanical construction of sandbars from dredged material. Least Terns are attracted to large areas of unvegetated substrate, yet small-scale habitat features are thought to trigger selection for nesting. We evaluated nest-scale habitat selection to determine (1) whether selection differs between constructed and natural sandbars and (2) the subsequent consequences of habitat selection on nest success. During 2006–2008, we examined 869 Least Tern nest sites on constructed and natural sandbars in the Missouri River for evidence of microhabitat selection at the nest in relation to habitat within the surrounding 3-m area. Least Tern nest sites had coarser and larger substrate materials at the nest, more debris, and less vegetation than the surrounding area. Nests in constructed habitats had a greater percentage of coarse substrates and less vegetation or debris than nests in naturally created habitats. Apparent nest success was 1.8× greater on constructed than on natural sandbars. Nest success was best predicted by models with two spatial scales of predictors, including substrates (nest) and vegetation and debris (nest or surrounding area). Our results indicate that Least Terns select nest microhabitat characteristics that are associated with wind- and water-scoured habitats, and that nest success increases when these habitats are selected.},

abstract = {Shorebirds, or waders, form an ecologically (but not phylogenetically) homogenous group of birds that, despite this homogeneity, exhibits clear correlated contrasts in habitat use and migration distance between closely related species pairs. In addition, within species there is distinct variation in breeding and wintering latitudes, i.e. migration distance. I examine here such contrasts at different taxonomic levels and evaluate what we can learn about selective forces on habitat selection and the evolution of migration strategies in birds. My primary example is the worldwide migration system of the Red Knot Calidris canutus. These sandpipers breed only on high arctic tundra (65-83 degrees N), but they move south from their disjunct, circumpolar breeding areas to nonbreeding sites on the coasts of all continents (except Antarctica), between latitudes 58 degrees N and 53 degrees S. Due to their specialized sensory capabilities, Red Knots generally eat hard-shelled prey found on intertidal, mostly soft, substrates. As a consequence, ecologically suitable coastal sites are few and far between, so they must routinely undertake flights of many thousands of kilometres. In contrast to prediction, Red Knots at tropical intertidal sites have lower fuelling rates than birds at more southern or northern latitudes. This leads to greater time-stress in the southernmost wintering populations that not only have to cover over 14,000 km in single migrations, but also cannot rely on tropical regions to make refuelling stops. Rapid human-caused losses of the food-base in staging areas during both north- and southward migrations have been demonstrated to have caused rapid declines in several Red Knot populations. Detailed worldwide ecodemographic research on these extreme long-distance migrants, as embodied in, for example, the recently established Global Flyway Network, yields a two-pronged benefit: (1) on the basis of the unintended large-scale experiments carried out by humans, we rapidly come to grips with the selection pressures moulding the migration strategies of migrant birds, and (2) in applied contexts, the work gives instantaneous feedbacks on the conservation consequences of man-made alterations to wetland environments at the relevant global spatial scales.},

abstract = {Scanning and flocking behaviour of 16 species of wader showing three different foraging strategies (pause-travel, visual continuous, tactile continuous) was studied to test predictions regarding the effect of foraging technique on such behaviours. The scanning hypothesis predicts that (1) pause-travel foraging species will spend less time vigilant and will scan less frequently than species using a continuous foraging strategy (either visual or tactile); the flocking hypothesis predicts that (2) visually hunting species (both pause-travel and visual continuous) will tend to form smaller flocks than tactile-foraging species. The results show differences between pause-travel and continuous foraging species in vigilance rate but not in time spent vigilant or in mean scan duration. The two continuous strategies did not differ in any variable related to scanning behaviour. However, with respect to flocking behaviour, both pause-travel and visual continuous-foraging species differed from tactile continuous-foraging species in foraging flock size. These results are discussed in the light of the syndrome hypothesis.},

abstract = {Rotational flow is often observed in lotic ecosystems, such as streams and rivers. For example, when an obstacle interrupts water flowing in a stream, energy dissipation and momentum transfer can result in the formation of rotational flow, or a vortex. In this study, I examined how rotational flow affects a predator-prey system by constructing a spatially explicit lattice model consisting of predators, prey, and plants. A predation relationship existed between the species. The species densities in the model were given as S (for predator), P (for prey), and G (for plant). A predator (prey) had a probability of giving birth to an offspring when it ate prey (plant). When a predator or prey was first introduced, or born, its health state was assigned an initial value of 20 that subsequently decreased by one with every time step. The predator (prey) was removed from the system when the health state decreased to less than zero. The degree of flow rotation was characterized by the variable, R. A higher R indicates a higher tendency that predators and prey move along circular paths. Plants were not affected by the flow because they were assumed to be attached to the streambed. Results showed that R positively affected both predator and prey survival, while its effect on plants was negligible. Flow rotation facilitated disturbances in individuals' movements, which consequently strengthens the predator and prey relationship and prevents death from starvation. An increase in S accelerated the extinction of predators and prey. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ecological theory for long-distance avian migration considers time-, energy-, and mortality-minimizing tactics, but predictions about the latter have proven elusive. Migrants must make behavioral decisions that can favor either migra- tory speed or safety from predators, but often not both. We compare the behavior of adult and juvenile western sandpipers Calidris mauri during the course of their temporally segregat- ed passages at a major stopover site. Here, the passage and winter arrival of an important predator, the peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus begins near the end of the adult sandpiper passage (July) and increases rapidly through the juvenile passage (August). The mortality-minimizing hypothesis pre- dicts that as the falcon front is distant but approaching, sand- pipers should initially increase the fuel-loading rate (lowered vigilance and predator apprehension) to increase migration speed and so maintain their head start. As the falcon front gains proximity to and passes over the stopover site, sand- pipers should become increasingly cautious. Our measure- ments show that adults decreased vigilance during the period prior to falcon arrival, and had lower vigilance overall than juveniles. Juveniles were more apprehensive, flying further and longer in response to disturbance by a falcon silhouette. This trend was reversed in response to a human approach. Both groups were more vigilant and more apprehensive in a study year with earlier falcon arrival. These results suggest that late (juvenile) and early (adult) migrants minimize mor- tality on migration in different ways, adults by increased migratory speed at the expense of caution on stopover sites, and juveniles by increased caution at the expense of speed.},

abstract = {Foraging in groups provides many benefits that are not necessarily experienced the same way by all individuals. I explore the possibility that foraging mode, the way individuals exploit resources, varies as a function of spatial position in the group, reflecting commonly occurring spatial differences in predation risk. I show that semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla), a social foraging avian species, tended to adopt a riskier foraging mode in the central, more protected areas of their groups. Central birds effectively used the more peripheral group members as sentinels, allowing them to exploit a wider range of resources within the same group at the same time. This finding provides a novel benefit of living in groups, which may have a broad relevance given that social foraging species often exploit a large array of resources.},

abstract = {Annual counts of migrating raptors at fixed observation points are a
widespread practice, and changes in numbers counted over time, adjusted
for survey effort, are commonly used as indices of trends in population
size. Unmodeled year-to-year variation in detectability may introduce
bias, reduce precision of trend estimates, and reduce power to detect
trends. We conducted dependent double-observer surveys at the annual
fall raptor migration count at Lucky Peak, Idaho, in 2009 and 2010 and
applied Huggins closed-capture removal models and information-theoretic
model selection to determine the relative importance of factors
affecting detectability. The most parsimonious model included effects of
observer team identity, distance, species, and day of the season. We
then simulated 30 years of counts with heterogeneous individual
detectability, a population decline (lambda = 0.964), and unexplained
random variation in the number of available birds. Imperfect
detectability did not bias trend estimation, and increased the time
required to achieve 80{\%} power by less than 11{\%}. Results suggested that
availability is a greater source of variance in annual counts than
detectability; thus, efforts to account for availability would improve
the monitoring value of migration counts. According to our models,
long-term trends in observer efficiency or migratory flight distance may
introduce substantial bias to trend estimates. Estimating detectability
with a novel count protocol like our double-observer method is just one
potential means of controlling such effects. The traditional approach of
modeling the effects of covariates and adjusting the index may also be
effective if ancillary data is collected consistently.},

abstract = {The upper Bay of Fundy is a critical stopover site for Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) during their fall migration. However, little is known about factors that influence selection of feeding and roosting sites by these birds, or the extent to which birds move between different sites during their time in the region. Using radio-telemetry, we studied movement patterns, examined habitat use, and tested hypotheses associated with factors influencing foraging and roost-site selection. Movements of radio-tagged sandpipers were tracked in the upper Bay of Fundy in August 2004 and 2005. In 2004, sandpipers from the Minas Basin, Nova Scotia and Chignecto Bay, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, were tracked, and in 2005, sandpipers were tracked only in Chignecto Bay. Sandpipers were highly mobile in both the Minas Basin 2004 and Chignecto Bay 2005, making daily movements of up to 20 km between foraging and roosting sites, although very little movement was detected in Chignecto Bay in 2004. Migrating sandpipers appeared to select foraging sites based on relative safety, as measured by distance to cover, provided that these sites offered an adequate food supply. Similarly, roosting sandpipers preferred sites that were far from nearby trees that might offer cover to predators. This preference for safe sites became more apparent later in their stay in the Bay of Fundy, when birds were heavier and, therefore, possibly more vulnerable to predation. Semipalmated Sandpipers appear to be flexible during their time in the upper Bay of Fundy, displaying year-to-year and site-to-site variability in movement and mudflat usage. Therefore, multiple, synchronized population counts should be conducted at known roost sites in order to more accurately estimate Semipalmated Sandpiper abundance in this region. Furthermore, in a highly dynamic system where food can be variable, landscape features such as distance to cover may be important factors to consider when selecting candidate sites for shorebird conservation measures.},

abstract = {We investigated the resource basis and energy budget of migrating knots Calidris canutus on spring stopover in NW Iceland. where large concentrations of birds deposit extensive fuel reserves for long distance flights to high arctic breeding grounds. Prey composition was determined on the basis of crushed shell and other fragments in faecal droppings. The daily foraging time, and dropping frequency, in two main intertidal habitats - seaweed beds on rocky shores and mudflats - was monitored in relation to the tidal cycle. Main food sources were 4-15 mm periwinkles Littorina spp. (providing 147 kJ of daily gross energy intake) taken from seaweed, and 8-23 mm common mussels Mytilus edulis (134 kJ), taken from both seaweed and mud. Additional contributions obtained froin mud include chironomid larvae (9 kJ), small gastropods (3 kJ) and probably also unidentified softbodied prey (about 73 kJ). Food resources at the stopover site are probably not limiting for the population of migrating knots. Estimated seasonal prey depletion rates were low, only 1-4{\%} for Littorina, 0.5-1.7{\%} for Mytilus and 11{\%} for chironomid larvae. The knots' estimated daily energy intake was below the predicted limit for maximum metabolisable energy intake. Although this indicates that the knots' rate of fuel deposition probably was constrained by food availability and foraging time rather than the metabolic capacity, it could not be ruled out that the knots at least on some days reach their metabolic ceiling for energy accumulation. A combination of factors may explain why the study region offers highly favourable stopover conditions for transient knots, and why the surplus of resources are not exploited instead for breeding or winter survival by resident shorebirds: (a) macrotidal variation; (b) pronounced seasonality; (c) combined exploitation of different intertidal habitats (seaweed and mud) during different tidal phases; (d) exuberant food availability. The shore crab and limpet are absent from the study region, which may explain the unusually high Littorina densities as a result of significant release from predation and competition, respectively.},

abstract = {A reduction in individual vigilance with an increase in group size is one of the most frequently reported relationships in the study of animal behaviour. It has been argued that this phenomenon may not be a direct consequence of an increase in group size but may be due to other factors relating to increased group size, such as increased foraging competition. However, there is evidence for a direct relationship between group size and vigilance where other variables have been controlled. The aim of this review is to highlight the fact that the functional explanation of the group size effect remains unclear. Some authors have considered just one hypothesis, the group vigilance or ‘many eyes' hypothesis. This states that, by taking advantage of the vigilance of other group members, individuals can reduce their own vigilance. However, there is an alternative, or additional, possibility that if individual vigilance declines with a reduction in individual predation risk, the group size effect could be accounted for by a reduction in individual risk at higher group sizes, as is widely thought to occur through encounter, dilution and confusion effects. In this review, it is shown that evidence previously interpreted in terms of one hypothesis may also be interpreted in terms of the other. Future research should be directed towards explicit consideration of the two effects and empirical tests to distinguish their relative importance. It is proposed that the individual risk hypothesis, with group vigilance as one element, provides a more general framework for understanding variation in vigilance behaviour with group size and with other factors.},

abstract = {Predation risk has negative indirect effects on prey fitness, partly mediated through changes in behaviour. Evidence that individuals gather social information from other members of the population suggests that events in a community may impact the behaviour of distant individuals. However, spatially wide-ranging impacts on individual behaviour caused by a predator encounter elsewhere in a community have not been documented before. We investigated the effect of a predator encounter (hawk model presented at a focal nest) on the parental behaviour of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), both at the focal nest and at nearby nests different distances from the predator encounter. We show that nest visitation of both focal pairs and nearby pairs were affected, up to 3 h and 1 h, respectively. Parents also appeared to compensate initial disrupted feeding by later increasing nest visitation rates. This is the first evidence showing that the behaviour of nearby pairs was affected away from an immediate source of risk. Our results indicate that the impacts of short-term predator encounters may immediately extend spatially to the broader community, affecting the behaviour of distant individuals. Information about predators is probably quickly spread by cues such as intra- and heterospecific alarm calls, in communities of different taxa.},

abstract = {Most of our understanding of habitat use by migrating land birds comes from studies conducted at single, small spatial scales, which may overemphasize the importance of intrinsic habitat factors, such as food availability, in shaping migrant distributions. We believe that a multi-scale approach is essential to assess the influence of factors that control en route habitat use. We determined the relative importance of eight variables, each operating at a habitat-patch, landscape, or regional spatial scale, in explaining the differential use of hardwood forests by Nearctic-Neotropical land birds during migration. We estimated bird densities through transect surveys at sites near the Mississippi coast during spring and autumn migration within landscapes with variable amounts of hardwood forest cover. At a regional scale, migrant density increased with proximity to the coast, which was of moderate importance in explaining bird densities, probably due to constraints imposed on migrants when negotiating the Gulf of Mexico. The amount of hardwood forest cover at a landscape scale was positively correlated with arthropod abundance and had the greatest importance in explaining densities of all migrants, as a group, during spring, and of insectivorous migrants during autumn. Among landscape scales ranging from 500 m to 10 km radius, the densities of migrants were, on average, most strongly and positively related to the amount of hardwood forest cover within a 5 km radius. We suggest that hardwood forest cover at this scale may be an indicator of habitat quality that migrants use as a cue when landing at the end of a migratory flight. At the patch scale, direct measures of arthropod abundance and plant community composition were also important in explaining migrant densities, whereas habitat structure was of little importance. The relative amount of fleshy-fruited trees was positively related and was the most important variable explaining frugivorous migrant density during autumn. Although constraints extrinsic to habitat had a moderate role in explaining migrant distributions, our results are consistent with the view that food availability is the ultimate factor shaping the distributions of birds during stopover.},

Sudden eruption of invading populations from low to high abundance may be viewed as a regime shift from one alternative state to another. Previous research proposed several types of early warning signals to predict regime shifts in ecological systems such as polluted lakes and semiarid grasslands. This paper explores theoretically the potential of such indicators in predicting demographic regime shifts of invading populations. I analyzed a stochastic differential equation model for the population dynamics of an invasive species subject to Allee effects and propagule pressure. Diffusion approximation to the stochastic model suggests that persistent propagule pressure makes demographic regime shifts inevitable, but Allee effects can lengthen the mean time until regime shifts virtually indefinitely. To compare the potential of indicators, I examined standard deviation, skewness, and estimated return rates of longitudinal population abundance. I found that standard deviation showed a distinct increase as regime shifts became more likely, but skewness and return rates showed no clear trends. This result suggests that standard deviation might be a useful warning signal for forecasting an impending demographic regime shift of invading populations during the period when their abundance is still low.},

abstract = {Infaunal benthic community structure can be affected by factors that operate locally (e.g., predation, competition, and disturbance) and regionally (e.g., recruitment, nutrient delivery). To determine the mechanisms driving distribution of a dominant infaunal clam, Macoma balthica, along a salinity (i.e., stress) gradient in the York River, Chesapeake Bay, I experimentally examined the effects of predation, recruitment, and food availability in shallow, subtidal, soft-bottom habitats. Specifically, in upriver and downriver zones I quantified: (1) the abundance of M. balthica; (2) the effect of predation on survival of M. balthica; (3) the abundance and foraging efficiency of major epibenthic predators; (4) the recruitment of M. balthica; and (5) the food availability for clams (sedimentary carbon). Consumer stress models predict that predators are more stressed in zones where salinity is lower and more variable (i.e., upriver); thus, predator-induced mortality should be lower upriver, potentially elevating the density of infaunal prey. In contrast to these models, in the York River, (1) natural abundance of M. balthica was higher upriver, (2) both predation-induced mortality in manipulative field experiments as well as field measurements of natural mortality of clams over time were higher upriver, though per capita foraging efficiency was lower, (3) predator abundance but not size was greater upriver where predation intensity was higher, (4) recruitment was lower upriver, and (5) food availability (sedimentary carbon) was greater upriver. Clam density, environmental stress, and per capita foraging efficiency were in accord with a consumer stress model of community regulation, whereas higher predator abundance and predation intensity in zones of higher environmental stress were contrary to the model's predictions. Recruitment did not dictate overall patterns of clam abundance, but habitat quality and nutrients appeared to drive prey and predator abundances. The patterns in this soft-bottom community are explained best by a productivity model, as reflected in a community governed principally by resource availability (i.e., bottom-up control), at a broad scale. This research suggests that structuring forces are similar for rocky intertidal, salt marsh, and soft-bottom communities at broad spatial scales. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Conserving migratory birds is made especially difficult because of
movement among spatially disparate locations across the annual cycle. In
light of challenges presented by the scale and ecology of migratory
birds, successful conservation requires integrating objectives,
management, and monitoring across scales, from local management units to
ecoregional and flyway administrative boundaries. We present an
integrated approach using a spatially explicit energetic-based
mechanistic bird migration model useful to conservation decision-making
across disparate scales and locations. This model moves a Mallard-like
bird (Anas platyrhynchos), through spring and fall migration as a
function of caloric gains and losses across a continental-scale energy
landscape. We predicted with this model that fall migration, where birds
moved from breeding to wintering habitat, took a mean of 27.5 d of
flight with a mean seasonal survivorship of 90.5{\%} (95{\%} CI = 89.2{\%},
91.9{\%}), whereas spring migration took a mean of 23.5 d of flight with
mean seasonal survivorship of 93.6{\%} (95{\%} CI = 92.5{\%}, 94.7{\%}).
Sensitivity analyses suggested that survival during migration was
sensitive to flight speed, flight cost, the amount of energy the animal
could carry, and the spatial pattern of energy availability, but
generally insensitive to total energy availability per se. Nevertheless,
continental patterns in the bird-use days occurred principally in
relation to wetland cover and agricultural habitat in the fall. Bird-use
days were highest in both spring and fall in the Mississippi Alluvial
Valley and along the coast and near-shore environments of South
Carolina. Spatial sensitivity analyses suggested that locations nearer
to migratory endpoints were less important to survivorship; for
instance, removing energy from a 1036 km(2) stopover site at a time from
the Atlantic Flyway suggested coastal areas between New Jersey and North
Carolina, including the Chesapeake Bay and the North Carolina piedmont,
are essential locations for efficient migration and increasing
survivorship during spring migration but not locations in Ontario and
Massachusetts. This sort of spatially explicit information may allow
decision-makers to prioritize their conservation actions toward
locations most influential to migratory success. Thus, this mechanistic
model of avian migration provides a decision-analytic medium integrating
the potential consequences of local actions to flyway-scale phenomena.},

abstract = {Honey bee foragers may use both personal and social information when making decisions about when to visit resources. In particular, foragers may stop foraging at resources when their own experience indicates declining resource quality, or when social information, namely the delay to being able to unload nectar to receiver bees, indicates that the colony has little need for the particular resource being collected. Here we test the relative importance of these two factors in a natural setting, where colonies are using many dynamically changing resources. We recorded detailed foraging histories of individually marked bees, and identified when they appeared to abandon any resources (such as flower patches) that they had previously been collecting from consistently. As in previous studies, we recorded duration of trophallaxis events (unloading nectar to receiver bees) as a proxy for resource quality and the delays before returning foragers started trophallaxis as a proxy for social need for the resource. If these proxy measures accurately reflect changes in resource quality and social need, they should predict whether bees continue foraging or not. However, neither factor predicted when individuals stopped foraging on a particular resource, nor did they explain changes in colony-level foraging activity. This may indicate that other, as yet unstudied processes also affect individual decisions to abandon particular resources.},

In addition to providing habitat for resident fish, shrimp and crabs, these tidal flats serve as critical feeding grounds for up to 5 million migratory shorebirds as well as an entry and exit corridor for three species of commercially fished salmonids, Here we report the first description of the benthic community of these inter-tidal flats. Between April and September 2000, we conducted three samplings on the Copper River Delta in which we quantified benthic macro-invertebrates inhabiting silt-clay sediments, the dominant substrate in the system, over a range of tidal inundation. Specifically, sampling was performed in two areas on the delta: near the outflows of the Eyak River and Pete Dahl Slough. Pore-water salinity of surficial sediment ranged from 4 psu during peak summer flow of the Copper River to 14 psu in April prior to increased riverine input. Sediment temperatures corresponded to ambient air temperatures with lowest temperatures during the April-September observation period recorded in April (4degreesC) and warmest in August (16degreesC). The benthic community of the delta's tidal flats was characterised by low species diversity and was dominated by the tellinid bivalve Maconia balthica, which reached densities greater than 4000 m(-2). Age-length relationship of M balthica indicated slow growth and longevity of up to 8 years. Polychaete densities, primarily the phyllodocid,Eteone longa, were low throughout the study period, reaching a maximum of only 700 m(-2) in August. Amphipod densities, primarily the corophid amphipod Corophium salmonis, were high (up to 7000 m(-2)) only during the August sampling. Spatial patterns of benthic invertebrate abundance were best explained by differences in tidal inundation with longer inundation corresponding to greater invertebrate densities. Temporal changes in abundance of polychaetes, amphipods, and M balthica recruits corresponded to increases in sediment temperatures. Natural or human-induced changes to M. balthica populations could impact the food web of the delta, which could cascade to larger geographic impacts because of the importance of the delta to migratory species.

abstract = {1. Calidris mauri Cabanis (Western Sandpiper) exhibits a pronounced post-growth age-dependent difference in small intestine size during southward migration, such that the later-migrating juveniles have larger small intestines than do the adults. Potential causes and consequences of this age-dependent difference are examined. 2. Premigrant juveniles of full structural size had small intestines that were 10{\%} longer than those of the premigrant adults, even though the juveniles had not attained asymptotic body mass. The elongated small intestines of premigrant juveniles appear to be growth-related. 3. Adults and juveniles exhibited parallel increases in intestinal length (7.0{\%}) and circumference (9.5{\%}) in association with the initiation of migration; these effects are consistent with migratory hyperphagia. 4. Refuelling juveniles had small intestines that were 8.5{\%} longer than those of the refuelling adults. Retaining an enlarged small intestine during migration confers increased digestive capacity to the juveniles, which may be under selection to minimize stopover duration. 5. Refuelling juveniles had a higher prevalence of cestode infection than refuelling adults in one of two years, and the length-corrected mass of the small intestine was 9.7{\%} heavier in infected individuals. Cestode infection may be an important determinant of migration-related mortality for juveniles, by compromising their health and increasing stopover duration.},

abstract = {Theory suggests that individual personality is tightly linked to individual life histories and to environmental variation. The reactive-proactive axis, for example, is thought to reflect whether individuals prioritize productivity or survival, mutually exclusive options that can be caused by conflicts between foraging and anti-predation behaviour. Evidence for this trade-off hypothesis, however, is limited. Here, we tested experimentally whether exploration behaviour (EB), an assay of proactivity, could explain how great tits (Parus major) respond to changes in starvation and predation risk. Individuals were presented with two feeders, holding good or poor quality food, which interchanged between safe and dangerous positions 10 m apart, across two 24 h treatments. Starvation risk was assumed to be highest in the morning and lowest in the afternoon. The proportion of time spent feeding on good quality food (PTG) rather than poor quality food was repeatable within treatments, but individuals varied in how PTG changed with respect to predation- and starvation-risk across treatments. This individual plasticity variation in foraging behaviour was linked to EB, as predicted by the reactive-proactive axis, but only among individuals in dominant social classes. Our results support the trade-off hypothesis at the level of individuals in a wild population, and suggest that fine-scale temporal and spatial variation may play important roles in the evolution of personality.},

@article{Lundquist2004,
abstract = {There has been widespread concern that reduction in density of broadcast spawners by a fishery can have severe effects on reproduction. As fishing decreases density, fertilization efficiency declines, so that reproduction declines more rapidly than indicated by density, producing an Allee effect. However, this potentially precipitous decline in reproduction with declining density or stock size is not well understood at the population level. We used a simple deterministic model of the reproductive dynamics of a broadcast spawning invertebrate to show that the abrupt threshold often proposed as the form of this Allee effect is possible only when individuals are evenly spaced, and when sperm dispersal distribution is a constant out to a specified distance. When the spatial distribution is random and the sperm dispersal distribution is either Gaussian or exponential, fertilization success is linear up to 100{\%}; thus, zygote production is quadratic up to this density. As the width of the dispersal function decreases, fertilization reaches 100{\%} at higher densities, so that it may be beyond the highest density experienced by the population. In that case, zygote production is functionally linear. We then used a simulation model to assess the effects of aggregative behavior and stochastic variability in spatial patterns. We compared narrow and broad sperm dispersal distributions that were based on empirically determined fertilization of the green sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, under two flow regimes. Zygote production exhibited a gradual nonlinear Allee effect as density decreased for the broader gamete dispersal distribution, but a functionally linear relationship with a much lower slope for the narrower sperm dispersal distributions. Increasing aggregation increased the slope of both fertilization and zygote production vs. density at the origin, but they remained linear for the narrower distribution. High interannual variability in zygote production due to different spatial configurations suggested that the geometric mean of recruitment is a better indicator of population consequences than the arithmetic mean, and it displays a sharper threshold than the arithmetic mean. Our results imply that potential Allee effects at low density in broadcast spawning populations rarely exhibit threshold behavior, and that these Allee effects may be too weak to be detected in stock-recruitment relationships.},

abstract = {There is a widespread concern about the direct and indirect effects of industrial fisheries; this concern is particularly pertinent for so-called "marine protected areas" (MPAs), which should be safeguarded by national and international law. The intertidal flats of the Dutch Wadden Sea are a State Nature Monument and are protected under the Ramsar convention and the European Union's Habitat and Birds Directives. Until 2004, the Dutch government granted permission for {\~{}}75{\%} of the intertidal flats to be exploited by mechanical dredgers for edible cockles (Cerastoderma edule). Here we show that dredged areas belonged to the limited area of intertidal flats that were of sufficient quality for red knots (Calidris canutus islandica), a long-distance migrant molluscivore specialist, to feed. Dredging led to relatively lower settlement rates of cockles and also reduced their quality (ratio of flesh to shell). From 1998 to 2002, red knots increased gizzard mass to compensate for a gradual loss in shellfish quality, but this compensation was not sufficient and led to decreases in local survival. Therefore, the gradual destruction of the necessary intertidal resources explains both the loss of red knots from the Dutch Wadden Sea and the decline of the European wintering population. This study shows that MPAs that do not provide adequate protection from fishing may fail in their conservation objectives.},

abstract = {Untangling the spatial and temporal processes that influence population dynamics of migratory species is challenging, because changes in abundance are shaped by variation in vital rates across heterogeneous habitats and throughout the annual cycle. We developed a full-annual-cycle, integrated population model and used demographic data collected between 2011 and 2014 in southern Indiana and Belize to estimate stage-specific vital rates of a declining migratory songbird, the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina). Our primary objective was to understand how spatial and temporal variation in demography contributes to local and regional population growth. Our full-annual-cycle model allowed us to estimate: 1) age-specific, seasonal survival probabilities, including latent survival during both spring and autumn migration, and 2) how the relative contribution of vital rates to population growth differed among habitats. Wood Thrushes in our study populations experienced the lowest apparent survival rates during migration and apparent survival was lower during spring migration than during fall migration. Both mortality and high dispersal likely contributed to low apparent survival during spring migration. Population growth in high-quality habitat was most sensitive to variation in fecundity and apparent survival of juveniles during spring migration, whereas population growth in low-quality sites was most sensitive to adult apparent breeding-season survival. These results elucidate how full-annual-cycle vital rates, particularly apparent survival during migration, interact with spatial variation in habitat quality to influence population dynamics in migratory species. },

However, the impact of vertebrate predators, particularly waterfowl, has been only infrequently determined in long-term intertidal studies. Using predator exclusion cages and simulated abiotic disturbance, I studied the direct and indirect effects of predation by Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima) on an intertidal mussel bed community in Passa-maquoddy Bay, New Brunswick, Canada. Eiders fed heavily on blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), the dominant invertebrate present, reducing their abundance in "+duck" (exposed to predation) relative to "-duck" (exclosure) plots by nearly 50{\%} within eight months of initiation of the experiment. Based on counts and estimated consumption rates, eiders appeared to be responsible for most predation observed in this system. Although ducks fed heavily on the dominant intertidal invertebrate, they had little effect on species diversity or richness in the community. However, relative abundance of the most common invertebrates did vary. In particular, exclusion of eiders led to an increase in abundance of dogwhelks (Nucella lapillus) one year into the experiment. Whelks, in turn, fed heavily on mussels under cages and obscured the longer-term effect of ducks in the system. This indirect effect appears to be an example of asymmetric exploitation competition, with ducks influencing the food supply of whelks, but whelks having little effect on ducks. When ducks were excluded, whelks were released from this competition and acted as compensating predators. No other indirect effects developed following duck exclusion, presumably due to the increased whelk effect. Disturbance, in contrast, did lead to an increase in species diversity, which later returned to predisturbance levels as the community recovered. Predation delayed the recovery of disturbed sites, because ducks began feeding in these plots before mussel abundance had completely rebounded. Disturbance, while initially deterring predation somewhat, ultimately allowed the effects of predators to persist longer. This interaction of predation and disturbance resulted from compensatory growth of mussels under exclosures in disturbed sites. Mussels protected from eider predation grew quickly after disturbance and rapidly became larger than the preferred prey for whelks. As a consequence, whelks did not feed as heavily on mussels in disturbed sites as in undisturbed sites, where more mussels were of the preferred size, and the observed effect of ducks on mussel biomass persisted. This experiment demonstrates that eiders were significant, and, probably, keystone predators in this system. Eiders directly reduced abundance of mussels, thereby indirectly increasing whelk density in plots where ducks were excluded. Compensatory predation by whelks following duck exclusion blocked other potential indirect effects, thus preventing eiders from having more widespread effects in the system. Such compensatory predation may act to stabilize communities and evidently can occur in relatively simple systems as well as the more species-rich communities with which it is usually associated.},

abstract = {Foraging behaviour in birds co-varies with bill morphology. Shorebirds exhibit pronounced inter- and intra-specific variation in bill length and shape as well as in foraging behaviour. Pecking, or feeding on epifaunal intertidal invertebrates, is associated with a straight bill, while probing, feeding on infaunal prey, is facilitated by bill curvature. Here, we used high resolution microscopy to study gross bill morphology of Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri). We showed that bills of males and females differed with regard to length but not curvature or depth, despite clear differences in foraging behaviour between the sexes. Detection of infaunal prey can be facilitated by the presence of Herbst corpuscles. These mechano-receptors are located in 'sensory pits' under the keratin layer of the bill and are able to sense pressure gradients. They are postulated to be common among calidrid sandpipers, but comparative data are lacking. Using high resolution microscopy, we measured number and size of sensory pits in Western Sandpipers, Least Sandpipers (Calidris minutilla) and Dunlin (Calidris alpina). The implications of these findings to foraging adaptations and non-breeding site choice are discussed.},

abstract = {Population-level studies of how tit species (Parus spp.) track the changing phenology of their caterpillar food source have provided a model system allowing inference into how populations can adjust to changing climates, but are often limited because they implicitly assume all individuals experience similar environments. Ecologists are increasingly using satellite-derived data to quantify aspects of animals' environments, but so far studies examining phenology have generally done so at large spatial scales. Considering the scale at which individuals experience their environment is likely to be key if we are to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes acting on reproductive phenology within populations. Here, we use time series of satellite images, with a resolution of 240 m, to quantify spatial variation in vegetation green-up for a 385-ha mixed-deciduous woodland. Using data spanning 13 years, we demonstrate that annual population-level measures of the timing of peak abundance of winter moth larvae (Operophtera brumata) and the timing of egg laying in great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) is related to satellite-derived spring vegetation phenology. We go on to show that timing of local vegetation green-up significantly explained individual differences in tit reproductive phenology within the population, and that the degree of synchrony between bird and vegetation phenology showed marked spatial variation across the woodland. Areas of high oak tree (Quercus robur) and hazel (Corylus avellana) density showed the strongest match between remote-sensed vegetation phenology and reproductive phenology in both species. Marked within-population variation in the extent to which phenology of different trophic levels match suggests that more attention should be given to small-scale processes when exploring the causes and consequences of phenological matching. We discuss how use of remotely sensed data to study within-population variation could broaden the scale and scope of studies exploring phenological synchrony between organisms and their environment.},

abstract = {This study characterizes the composition and spatial distribution patterns of the benthic macrofauna in the intertidal mudflats of the Tagus estuary, western Portugal. A total of 68 species, more than 226,000 specimens with a total wet weight biomass of approximately 1170 g were identified in 380 sites. The species Streblospio shrubsolii, Cyathura carinata, Tharyx sp., Hydrobia ulvae and Tubificids were the most common and abundant. Scrobicularia plana strongly dominated the biomass. The invertebrate macrofauna of the Tagus estuary shows similarities to what is known from other temperate mudflats. The diversity of species, their overall abundance and the ratio of Molluscs plus Crustaceans to Polychaete species corroborate the distinctiveness between temperate and tropical mudflats and sandflats. The spatial distribution of the fauna reflects the sediment characteristics but the relationship between the environmental and the biological data is not as strong as obtained for sublittoral areas. This relationship diminishes from the sublittoral shelf to sublittoral estuarine areas, showing minimum values in this study, suggesting that such a relationship is less straightforward as natural disturbance increases. Nevertheless, a mixture of grain-size, elevation (inundation time) and particular habitats (relic oyster beds) form the best explanatory factors for the spatial distribution patterns of the intertidal benthic macrofauna of the Tagus estuary.},

abstract = {In this paper, the main aspects of agricultural intensification that have led to population declines in farmland birds over the past 50 years are reviewed, together with the current state of knowledge, and the effects of recent conservation actions. For each of 30 declining species, attention is focused on: (1) the external causes of population declines, (2) the demographic mechanisms and (3) experimental tests of proposed external causal factors, together with the outcome of (4) specific conservation measures and (5) agri-environment schemes. Although each species has responded individually to particular aspects of agricultural change, certain groups of species share common causal factors. For example, declines in the population levels of seed-eating birds have been driven primarily by herbicide use and the switch from spring-sown to autumn-sown cereals, both of which have massively reduced the food supplies of these birds. Their population declines have been associated with reduced survival rates and, in some species, also with reduced reproductive rates. In waders of damp grassland, population declines have been driven mainly by land drainage and the associated intensification of grassland management. This has led to reduced reproductive success, as a result of lowered food availability, together with increased disturbance and trampling by farm stock, and in some localities increased nest predation. The external causal factors of population decline are known (with varying degrees of certainty) for all 30 species considered, and the demographic causal factors are known (again with varying degrees of certainty) for 24 such species. In at least 19 species, proposed causal factors have been tested and confirmed by experiment or by local conservation action, and 12 species have been shown to benefit (in terms of locally increased breeding density) from options available in one or more agri-environment schemes. Four aspects of agricultural change have been the main drivers of bird population declines, each affecting a wide range of species, namely: (1) weed-control, mainly through herbicide use; (2) the change from spring-sown to autumn-sown cereal varieties, and the associated earlier ploughing of stubbles and earlier crop growth; (3) land drainage and associated intensification of grassland management; and (4) increased stocking densities, mainly of cattle in the lowlands and sheep in the uplands. These changes have reduced the amounts of habitat and/or food available to many species. Other changes, such as the removal of hedgerows and ‘rough patches', have affected smaller numbers of species, as have changes in the timings of cultivations and harvests. Although at least eight species have shown recent increases in their national population levels, many others seem set to continue declining, or to remain at a much reduced level, unless some relevant aspect of agricultural practice is changed.},

I controlled for prey density and flock size because these variables may influence both the foraging rates as well as the effect of human disturbance on feeding efficiency. Semipalmated plovers decreased feeding rates when there were more people on the beach (multiple regression: F1,15=5.86, b=0.59, P=0.029, R2=37.6{\%}). For least sandpipers, the effect of human densities on feeding rates depended on flock size (F1,21=5.97, P=0.023) and amphipod availability (F1,21=4.98, P=0.037). This study demonstrated the importance of measuring subtle behavioural changes in foraging rates along with key ecological variables in order to assess the true impact of human disturbance on migratory shorebirds.},

Rather than being constant, the strength of density dependence may vary throughout the year, but empirical evidence is limited. Based on 22 years of data of color-banded birds from a recovering population of Eurasian Spoonbills Platalea leucorodia leucorodia, we show, for the first time, seasonal variation in density dependence in survival of a long-distance migrating bird. Combining resightings and dead recoveries at breeding, stopover, and nonbreeding areas enabled us to (1) separate true survival from permanent emigration from the breeding area, and (2) estimate survival in three seasons: summer, early winter (including autumn migration), and late winter (including spring migration). Accompanying the rapid population growth, juvenile annual survival initially increased, manifested in early winter, but thereafter, at high population sizes, it strongly decreased through a combination of decreasing survival in all seasons. Annual survival of subadult (second- and third-year) and adult birds decreased more gradually with increasing population size, with density dependence occurring in early winter for subadults and late winter for adults. Thus, the shape and strength of density dependence in survival varied with age and season. Understanding the seasonal timing of density dependence, especially with reference to underlying mechanisms, is important for the design of effective conservation strategies.},

abstract = {Foraging animals interact with their food resources in complex ways, both responding to and creating variation in resource quality, quantity, distribution, and structure. The reciprocity of this interaction means that the value of food resources at any given moment is a property of both the landscape and the foraging animal. Traditional approaches to assessing landscape condition for large herbivores have relied upon coarse measurements of vegetation properties such as biomass as though they are equally applicable to all herbivores in the system; however, because different herbivore species will have differences in the way they perceive vegetation, changes to the quantity and quality of vegetation in a landscape will be interpreted differently by different herbivore species. This variation means that vegetation measurements often fail to adequately capture the true value of a resource for a foraging animal. We advocate a new approach to assessing landscape conditions for large herbivores. It invokes the use of behavioral indicators to measure the value of "foodscapes" to foraging animals. Foodscapes are inherently animal-centric, and are defined by using foraging behavior to measure the value that an animal places on the vegetation within its environment. In effect, foodscapes define what the "resource" is to the animal. We demonstrate our approach by summarizing the behavioral responses of grazing ruminants to two very relevant drivers of ecosystem change, CO2 enrichment and land-use change. We use these responses to develop a suite of behavioral indicators that are sufficient to detect critical changes in the value of the foodscape for grazing ruminants. Our analysis demonstrates the potential for using behavioral indicators to enable early detection of critical changes in forage value that would fail to be recognized by traditional approaches.},

In this study, I compared the behavior and hunting efficiency of wintering merlins (Palco columbarius) and peregrine falcons (E peregrinus ) that hunted dunlins (Calidris alpina) at coastal estuarine and beach habitats in Washington to determine whether hunting efficiency was related to differences in habitat. Flocks of up to 15,000 dunlins moved 2-15 km from estuarine sites to roost and forage at beaches during diurnal high tides. Both falcon species regularly attacked flocks of dunlins in each habitat. The success rates of hunting flights for both species (merlin: 7.8{\%}, peregrine falcon: 12.5{\%}) were significantly lower at beaches than previously reported for estuaries. Dunlins at the beach habitat roosted in flocks near water's edge and avoided falcons by flying out over the ocean where flocks engaged in synchronized flight in the troughs between waves. Most capture attempts by falcons occurred over water even though the likelihood of successful capture was lower there. Neither age of the hunting raptor (peregrine falcon only) nor relative density of potential kleptoparasites influenced hunting suc- cess. Several hypotheses are presented to explain differences in hunting efficiency between the two habitats.},

We reviewed the literature and found that only 21{\%} of studies that used a behavioural approach to study human disturbance focused on multiple species. These studies identified a number of potential predictive variables. 3. We developed a simulation model that investigates interspecific variation in different parameters of disturbance with variation in human visitation. We found that fitness-related responses, such as the quantity of food consumed by a species, are relatively sensitive to the distance at which animals detect humans, the frequency of disturbance by humans and the interaction of these factors, but are less sensitive to other characteristics. 4. We examined avian alert distance (the distance animals first orientated to an approaching threat, a proxy for detection distance) across 150 species, controlling for phylogenetic effects. We found that larger species had greater alert distances than smaller species, which could increase local spatial and temporal limitations on suitable habitat with increasing human visitation. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that body size could be a potential predictor of responses to human disturbance across species, and could be used by managers to make conservation decisions regarding levels of human visitation to a protected site. We suggest that three things are essential to develop predictive models of how different species will respond to human disturbance. First, multiple indicators of disturbance should be studied to select those with lower intraspecific variation for a given study system. Secondly, the species-specific nature of responses should be identified. Thirdly, life history, natural history and other correlates with these species-specific responses must be assessed.},

abstract = {Long-distance bird migration is fueled by energy gathered at stopover sites along the migration route. The refueling rate at stopover sites is a determinant of time spent at stopovers and impacts the overall speed of migration. Refueling rate during spring migration may influence the fitness of individuals via changes in the probability of successful migration and reproduction during the subsequent breeding season. We evaluated four plasma lipid metabolites (triglycerides, phospholipids, beta-OH-butyrate, and glycerol) as measures of refueling rate in free-living semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) captured at non-breeding areas. We described the spatial and temporal variation in metabolite concentrations among one winter site in the Dominican Republic and four stopover sites in the South Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain regions of North America. Triglycerides and beta-OH-butyrate clearly identified spatial variation in refueling rate and stopover habitat quality. Metabolite profiles indicated that birds had higher refueling rates at one site in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain than at three sites on the South Atlantic Coastal Plain and one site in the Dominican Republic. Temporal variation in lipid metabolites during the migration season suggested that male semipalmated sandpipers gained more weight at stopovers on the South Atlantic Coastal Plain than did females, evidence of differential migration strategies for the sexes. Plasma lipid metabolites provide information on migration physiology that may help determine stopover habitat quality and reveal how migratory populations use stopover sites to refuel and successfully complete long-distance migrations.},

abstract = {Although the occurrence of individuals' behavioral differences in a "shyness-boldness" continuum (i.e., animals' propensity to take risks) is well established from experimental studies, little is known about how this personality trait might influence individual predation risk management decisions in natural systems. We recorded the risk management strategies (RMS) of a natural population of redshanks by observing the daily behavioral decisions made by foraging individuals. These included proximity to neighbors, flock size, position with respect to predator concealing cover, and vigilance. Using hierarchical mixed effects models, we found that although variation in most of these RMS had a significant individual component, only vigilance was moderately repeatable and therefore a personality trait. There was no evidence for a behavioral risk management syndrome: there were no significant correlations of vigilance with aggressiveness or exploratory behavior. Vigilance levels were highly flexible, were adjusted to the riskiness of the situation, and individuals varied in the degree of this plasticity, suggesting that a redshank's boldness (personality) may only contribute a small amount to natural risk management and that it is situation dependent. This emphasizes that although variable risk and profitability in the environment may select for different personalities (e.g., that determine baseline levels of vigilance all things being equal), these baseline levels can be modified greatly through behavioral flexibility when individuals are confronted by a change in environmental context, potentially removing these differences.},

Developing an understanding of the proximate and ultimate causes for this behaviour not only addresses fundamental ecological questions but has relevance to many other fields, for example in relation to the spread of emerging zoonotic diseases, the proliferation of invasive species, aeronautical safety as well as the conservation of migrants. * Theoretical methods can make important contributions to our understanding of migration, by allowing us to integrate findings on this complex behaviour, identify caveats in our understanding and to guide future empirical research efforts. Various mechanistic models exist to date, but their applications seem to be scattered and far from evenly distributed across taxonomic units. * Therefore, we provide an overview of the major mechanistic modelling approaches used in the study of migration behaviour and characterize their fundamental features, assumptions and limitations and discuss their typical data requirements both for model parameterization and for scrutinizing model predictions. * Furthermore, we review 155 studies that have used mechanistic models to study animal migration and analyse them with regard to the approaches used and the focal species, and also explore their contribution to advancing current knowledge within six broad migration ecology research themes. * This identifies important gaps in our present knowledge, which should be tackled in future research using existing and to-be developed theoretical approaches.},

abstract = {Bird migration has been assumed, mostly implicitly, to represent a distinct class of animal behavior, with deep and strong homologies in the various phenotypic expressions of migratory behavior between different taxa. Here the evidence for the existence of what could be called a "migratory syndrome," a tightly integrated, old group of adaptive traits that enables birds to commit themselves to highly organized seasonal migrations, is assessed. A list of problems faced by migratory birds is listed first and the traits that migratory birds have evolved to deal with these problems are discussed. The usefulness of comparative approaches to investigate which traits are unique to migrants is then discussed. A provisional conclusion that, perhaps apart from a capacity for night-time compass orientation, there is little evidence for deeply rooted co-adapted trait complexes that could make up such a migratory syndrome, is suggested. Detailed analyses of the genetic and physiological architecture of potential adaptations to migration, combined with a comparative approach to further identify the phylogenetic levels at which different adaptive traits for migration have evolved, are recommended.},

abstract = {In mark–recapture studies conducted on fixed-area study sites, apparent (or “local”) survival (ϕ) is the product of the probabilities of true survival (S) and site fidelity to the sampling area (F). If marked individuals permanently emigrate from the study site, apparent survival will be biased low relative to true survival. Similarly, estimates of mate fidelity will be biased high because site fidelity is typically higher for individuals that reunite with their previous mates than among pairs that divorce. Here, we develop a method for calculating site fidelity that takes plot boundaries into account, based on a dispersal model estimated from local movements within a fixed study site. We use dispersal estimates to adjust apparent survival and mate fidelity for the effects of short-distance movements out of a fixed area. We demonstrate our method with a retrospective analysis of a published study of 2 species of sandpipers breeding sympatrically at a field site in western Alaska. Estimates of survival probability increased by 0.01–0.03 for males and 0.07–0.08 for females in both species. The larger adjustments for females were expected based on their longer local dispersal movements. Adjusted mate fidelity estimates were lower than the original estimates by 0.04–0.07. Use of local movement data to estimate site fidelity cannot account for permanent emigration due to long-distance movements and, if such movements occur, our adjusted estimates of ϕ remain a function of true survival and site fidelity. Nevertheless, our method can reduce bias in demographic parameters resulting from local dispersal movements, improving estimates of annual survival and mate fidelity for use in demographic models.},

abstract = {The effect of competition for a limiting resource on the population dynamics of competitors is usually assumed to operate directly through starvation, yet may also affect survival indirectly through behaviourally mediated effects that affect risk of predation. Thus, competition can affect more than two trophic levels, and we aim here to provide an example of this. We show that the foraging success of redshanks Tringa totanus (L.) foraging on active prey was highest in the front of flocks, whereas this was not the case for redshanks foraging on inactive prey. Also, when foraging on active prey, foraging success in a flock decreased as more birds passed through a patch, while overall foraging success was not lower on subsequent visits to the same patch. Thus, redshanks foraging on active prey suffered from interference competition, whereas this was not the case for redshanks foraging on inactive prey. This interference competition led to differences in activity: redshanks attaining a lower foraging success had a higher walking rate. Greater activity was associated with wider flock spacing and shorter distances to cover, which has previously been shown to increase predation risk and mortality from sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus (L.). We conclude that behavioural adaptations of prey species can lead to interference competition in foraging redshanks, and thus can affect their predation risk and mortality through increased activity. This study is one of the first to show how interference competition can be a mechanism for behaviourally mediated indirect effects, and provides further evidence for the suggestion that a single species occupying an intermediate trophic level may be simultaneously top-down controlled by a predator and bottom-up controlled by a behavioural response of its prey.},

Annual mean bill and wing lengths declined over the course of the study. As eastern Semipalmated Sandpipers have longer bills and wings than those from the west, we interpret the decline to be the result of a reduced proportion of eastern birds in our samples. Semipalmated Sandpiper populations are in decline in North America, and our data suggest that the decline may be more severe in the eastern part of their breeding range. Body mass and size-adjusted mass at the migratory stopover study site have not declined during the study, suggesting that feeding conditions have not deteriorated there. Possibly, differing conditions experienced on the breeding grounds or overwintering areas may explain why eastern populations of Semipalmated Sandpipers may be declining more severely than those from the west.

abstract = {Biological and physical factors interact to determine habitat use by animals. While sessile organisms inhabiting intertidal areas have been well studied, the processes underlying the use of intertidal areas by highly mobile animals such as fishes remain poorly understood. This study examines whether an intertidal fish, the mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus, preferentially uses habitats where growth rate is maximized or, like most sessile animals, is restricted to habitats providing escape from strong negative biological interactions but compromising growth. I compared growth rates and predation rates on adult F. heteroclitus at 3 Rhode Island salt marshes in 2 seasons (summer and fall). Salt marshes varied in the types of habitat (creek, pond, channel, mudflat) available to fishes within each marsh. Growth rates of marked mummichogs held in cages were determined in each habitat and each marsh for 6 wk. Predation risk was assessed by determining mortality of F. heteroclitus tethered in each habitat in each of the 2 seasons. Habitat use was quantified by trapping fish in each habitat in each season. Both growth rate and predation risk influenced habitat use by F. heteroclitus in these intertidal salt marshes. Overall, salt marshes offered opportunities for both higher growth rates and shelter from predation compared to areas outside salt marshes. However, mummichogs often faced trade-offs between predation refuge and growth in specific habitat types. When predation risk was high across all habitat types in a marsh, habitats associated with the highest growth rates were used. If a predation refuge was available, habitat use increased, even when growth rates in the habitat were low. A habitat characterized by both shelter and high growth rates, e.g. Coggeshall Cove ponds in fall. were used almost exclusively. Variation in quality of the same habitat type in different marshes led to differences in overall marsh quality. Determination of profitability of habitat for fishes cannot be assessed through habitat use alone; measurement of factors, such as predation risk and growth, which influence habitat quality are also necessary.},

abstract = {1. Basal metabolic rates (BMR) were measured in 36 adult and 119 juvenile waders of 19 species on autumn migration in southern Sweden. 2. Ina comparison with literature data, it was found that juvenile BMR was generally lower than at the onset of migration in the Arctic and slightly higher than on African wintering grounds. 3. The seasonal differences may reflect local physiological adaptations or possibly a gradual decline from high premigratory levels due to growth. Our data contradict the idea that BMR is high during migration as an adaptation to generally high levels of energy expenditure. 4. The allometric exponent, scaling BMR to body mass, was significantly higher within individuals (1.19) and within species (1.82) than among species (0.62). 5. The high intra-individual exponent indicates that non-fat tissues, with a high metabolic activity, are involved in the mass changes during migratory stopover. 6. The high intraspecific exponent indicates that tissues with a high metabolic activity contributed disproportionately to variation in body mass among individuals or that larger individuals had elevated mass specific metabolic rates of some tissues.},

During a ship-based expedi- tion to arctic Canada, we caught waders at seven, mainly coastal sites, with- in 68°-76°N and 139°-67°W, from 28 July to 31 August 1999. More than two hundred waders of twelve species were trapped, mainly White-rumped Calidris fuscicollis, Semipalmated C. pusilla, Baird's C. bairdii and Buff- breasted Sandpipers Tryngites subruficollis. The vast majority of the birds were juveniles. Body masses and visual fat stores were low, close to the lowest values found anywhere during the non-breeding season for the dif- ferent species. The relatively fattest birds were Buff-breasted Sandpipers, but they were still far from their maximum body mass on spring migration. We conclude that juvenile arctic waders depart from their natal areas with only small fuel stores, which is in concordance with a time-minimising migration strategy.},

abstract = {This article describes the graphics facilities of the R language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. There is a brief introduction to basic plotting functions in R, followed by a description of the organisation of R graphics into coherent and consistent sets of graphics functions, plus an indication of what sorts of plots each set of functions can produce. There is also a brief discussion of the limitations of R graphics. One of the features that draws many users to R1 is the graphics sub-system. The main features that distinguish R from themany other software systems that can be used to produce plots are that R provides facilities for creating a very wide range of statistical plots, R allows for very fine control over the appearance of plots, and R produces plots that are suitable for professional publication. This article provides an overview of the basic features of R graphics, along with some simple examples of how to produce plots using R. The general structure and organisation of R graphics is also described to give the reader some indication of how to explore R graphics system further. While some graphical user interfaces exist for R, and some of these provide menu items for producing plots, the only way to make use of the full power of the R graphics system is to write R code, so this article will only address the R code that can be used to produce plots .},

abstract = {The British Columbia Coastal Waterbird Survey is a citizen science long-term monitoring program implemented by Bird Studies Canada to assess population trends and ecological needs of waterbirds using the province's coastal and inshore marine habitats. Standard monthly counts from more than 200 defined sites within the Strait of Georgia were analysed using route-regression techniques to estimate population indices and assess trends in 57 waterbird species over a 12-year period spanning the non-breeding periods from 1999-2000 to 2010-11. A power analysis was also conducted to validate the rigor of the survey design. Results indicate that the survey is detecting annual changes of 3{\%} or less for populations of 29 waterbirds of a wide variety of guilds. Thirty-three species showed stable populations or no trend, 22 species showed significantly declining trends, and just three species showed significant increasing trends. We evaluate these results in the context of other long-term monitoring initiatives in the Salish Sea, highlighting specific birds to watch from a conservation perspective. Among those that showed a declining trend were a guild of piscivores, including Western and Horned Grebes, Common, Red-throated and Pacific Loons, and Rhinoceros Auklet; several sea ducks (Black and White-winged Scoters, Long-tailed Duck, Barrow's Goldeneye, Harlequin Duck); two shorebirds (Dunlin, Surfbird); and Great Blue Heron. In the stable/no trend group were 20 species for which the Salish Sea is of recognised global or continental conservation importance, including one grebe, two cormorants, eight waterfowl (including five diving ducks), three shorebirds and two gulls. Next steps in the application of the B. C. Coastal Waterbird Survey and related datasets to conservation and research management questions are discussed, underscoring the importance of continued monitoring using this cost-effective approach and expanding the use of these data to hypothesis-testing to investigate factors potentially driving population changes.},

abstract = {We consider the model of spatially distributed community consisting of two species with ``predator-prey{\{}''{\}} interaction; each of the species occupies two stations. Transfer of individuals between the stations (migration) is not random, and migration stipulates the maximization of net reproduction of each species. The spatial distribution pattern is provided by discrete stations, and the dynamics runs in discrete time. For each time moment, firstly a redistribution of individuals between the stations is carried out to maximize the net reproduction, and then the reproduction takes place, with the upgraded abundances. Besides, three versions of the basic model are implemented where each species implements reflexive behaviour strategy to determine the optimal migration flow. It was found that reflexivity gives an advantage to the species realizing such strategy, for some specific sets of parameters. Nevertheless, the regular scanning of the parameters area shows that non-reflexive behaviour yields an advantage in the great majority of parameters combinations.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT. The importance of phytoplankton, benthic microalgae, fresh and salt marsh emergent plants, and terrestrial organic matter to the estuarine food web of Plum Island Sound, Massachusetts, USA, was evaluated using the stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur. Three distinct regions of the estuary were examined: the oligohaline upper estuary with high freshwater inputs and fringing fresh marsh, the middle estuary with extensive salt marsh, and the lower estuary with a greater pro- portion of open bay and a direct connection to open ocean. In each region, sources of organic matter for pelaglc and benthic aquatlc consumers were compared with the range of organic matter sources avail- able in the entire estuary. Consumers in all regions relied most heavily on locally produced organic matter. In the upper estuary, most consumers had 613C values of -29 to -21'L and 634S values of about 8?L, whlch indicated dependence on a mixture of fresh marsh emergent vegetation and phytoplankton from the oligohaline region. In the middle and lower estuary, consumers had 613C values of -23 to -15'k and 634S values of 5 to 154., resembling a mixture of Spal-tina spp., benthic m{\~{}}croalgae and marine phytoplankton. Terrestrial organic matter was of minimal importance in the upper estuary and was not evident in the food webs of the middle and lower estuary. The isotopic values of pelagic con- sumers reflected a greater dependence on phytoplankton than those of benthic consumers, which were closer to fresh or salt marsh emergent vegetation and benthic microalgae. Several of the patterns revealed by examination of organic matter sources for the food web of the Plum Island Sound estuary have implications for our general understanding of estuarine food webs. First, while there is substantial spatial heterogeneity in organic matter sources within a single estuary, consumers tend to utilize sources of organic matter produced In the same region of the estuary in which they reside. Second, con- sumer dependence on terrestrially derived riverine organic matter is minimal, even in the relatively small region of the estuary where {\~{}}ts availability is the highest Third, benthic and pelag{\~{}}c organisms rely on different mixes of organic matter sources.

Culmen and wing chord data were collected as indices of structural body size at three sites that vary latitudinally: Ecuador, Panama, and Mexico. Within all sex and age categories, larger individuals (i.e., those with longer culmens and wing chords) and those with a disproportionately longer wing chord relative to the culmen migrated farther south. Our results, coupled with known molting schedules, indicate that i) immature sandpipers that grow disproportionately longer primary feathers on breeding grounds migrate farther during their first southward migration, and ii) adults that fly farther grow disproportionately longer primary feathers on the nonbreeding grounds. Although no single-factor hypothesis accounts for all aspects of age, sex, and size of Western Sandpiper distributions, costs asso- ciated with flight during migration play a significant role in determining differential nonbreeding latitudi- nal distributions.},

abstract = {To determine whether pattern and diversity in benthic sedimentary communities are set primarily at colonization or by post-settlement biological interactions, we collected faunal cores and conducted reciprocal sediment transplant experiments at a sandy and a muddy site at 12 m depth, similar to3 km apart off New Jersey. Multivariate analyses of cores collected at these sites in September 1994 indicated differences in the taxa determining local pattern, with the bivalve Spisula solidissima and the polychaete Polygordius sp. being dominant at the sandy site, and oligochaetes, several polychaete species, and the bivalve Nucula annulata dominant at the muddy site, Individual cores from the sandy site were significantly less diverse than those at the muddy site. Short-term experiments (3-5 d) were deployed by divers at three different times (August-September, 1994). Replicate trays (100 cm(2)) filled with azoic sand or mud were placed flush with the ambient seafloor at both sites. Multivariate comparisons indicated that sediment treatment in trays played a greater role in determining colonization patterns in the first experiment, site played a greater role in the second, and both variables contributed in the third, This pattern suggests that larval settlement and habitat choice played an important role in the first and third experiments, and that local transport of recently settled juveniles from the surrounding sediments was important in the second and third experiments. Sandy-site trays had significantly lower diversity than muddy-site trays, but there was no effect of sediment type in trays on diversity of colonizers. These experiments focused on small spatial scales and three short time periods, but they demonstrate that species patterns in some environments may be set by habitat selection by larvae and by juvenile colonization from the surrounding community, Post-co Ionization processes such as predation and competition likely play a major role for some species, but patterns of initial colonization corresponded well with those in the local community.},

abstract = {The breeding success of many species depends on the alignment of the period of maximum demand of offspring with a period of food abundance. In this paper, we use piecewise-smooth differential equations to model the variation in the size of a population that has a short interval each year during which successful reproduction is possible. An increase in spring-time temperatures in recent decades has caused these intervals to advance, leading to temporal mismatches between species on different trophic levels. We first consider a one-species model which illustrates the dynamics of a population of specialist feeders over the course of a single breeding season and use it to examine how reproductive success depends on the population's distribution of breeding dates. We then introduce time-dependent switches to extend the model to a broader class of species. Steady-state solutions are used to measure the extent to which a migratory population can sustain itself over long time scales and repeated breeding events. The model's predictions agree with the observed negative effect on population size associated with an advance in the food season if not adequately compensated for by the population. Finally, we discuss how this model can be extended in order to encompass a wider range of ecological systems and to highlight the mechanisms over which climate change may exert an influence.},

@article{Abbott1977,
abstract = {Distribution, abundance, diet, and beak morphology of the six Geospiza finch species were studied at eight sites on seven Galapagos islands. The resulting information was used to test the theories of Lack and Bowman that interspecific competition (Lack) and floristic and food differences among islands (Bowman) determine the ecological and morphological characteristics of the finches. Both factors were found to be important in different aspects of finch ecology. Most of the 21 populations studied spent more time foraging for seeds and fruits than for insects. Most populations had generalized diets and nine out of 18 pairs of sympatric populations had diets overlapping by 50{\%} or more. Diet breadth was positively correlated with variety of available foods (classified by an index comprising measures of size and hardness), but was not correlated with abundance or biomass of sympatric populations of finches (potential competitors). Competitive release, in the form of large population biomass on islands with few congeners, was not found. Nor was population biomass related to variety of available food. Overlap in diet between two species was greatest when the species were most similar in abundance and body size. Interspecific competition is indicated by the distribution and morphology of the finches. The absence of four combinations of species cannot be attributed to change: (1) G. conirostris and G. fortis, (2) G. conirostris and G. scandens, (3) G. difficilis and G. fuliginosa, and (4) G. scandens and G. difficilis. These absences cannot be attributed to the absence of suitable foods. and sites with similar floras and suites of food types do not necessarily have similar ground finch faunas. The ecological and morphological similarity of members of each of the four pairs suggests an inability to coexist for competitive reasons. In contrast, where only two species occur together on an island they tend to differ markedly in size (beak and body) and diet. Species with large beaks can eat larger and harder seeds and fruits than species with small beaks, and as a consequence they tend to have more diverse diets. Species with large beaks also eat medium-sized seeds and fruits quicker than species with small beaks. Species with small beaks may be able to deal with small soft seeds more efficiently than species with large beaks, but the data are not clear on this point. In addition, small species with small beaks have a metabolic advantage over large species with large beaks. Variety of available foods influences the large species more than the small species: the two largest species, G. magnirostris and G. conirostris, occur only on sites where plants producing large and hard seeds and fruits are plentiful. Food variety apparently does not influence the degree of diet overlap. The number of plant species on an island statistically determines the number of land-bird species in general, and Geospiza species in particular, which occur on that island. The influence is probably mediated through food supply, since 53{\%} of the variation in Geospiza species diversity among the eight sites was accounted for in a multiple linear regression analysis by diversity of available seeds and fruits. We conclude that food supply and interspecific competition have jointly determined the ecological course of the radiation of Darwin's finches and the resulting pattern of species diversity. Interisland variation in vegetation favored the initial steps of differentiation. Competitive interactions among species influenced later stages by determining which ecological types could coexist on an island with a given array of foods.

abstract = {Coastal habitats are critical for conservation of migrant shorebirds. We examined the effect of beach closure on recreationists and on shorebirds, at an important southbound stopover area for shorebirds at Brigantine, New Jersey. The study had three prongs: 1) involve stakeholders during all phases, 2) assess public use of the beach and responses to closure, and 3) assess shorebird use of the beach and response to closure. Stakeholders were involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of the project. The beach was used for fishing, walking, dog-walking, and other recreational activities. Sixty percent of recreationists were positive about the study and beach closure to protect shorebirds. The data indicate that: 1) involving a wide range of stakeholders early and often was important to our ability to conduct, design, and implement the study, 2) the beach was used by different types of recreationists 3) beach users were supportive of the closure, 4) spatial use by shorebirds depended upon whether the beach was open or closed, especially for red knot, and 5) all species of shorebirds used a small beach area behind a protective fence whether the beach was open or closed. Red knot behavior was most affected by beach closure; they spread out over the entire beach when it was closed, and concentrated at the tip when it was open. Conservation measures should take into account stakeholders views, human uses, beach physiognomy, and potential closure of refuge areas during critical migration times for shorebirds. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {We monitored the inter-wetland movements of 115 radio-tagged Pectoral Sandpipers (Calidris melanotos) at three migration stopovers in the Great Plains of North America during April and May from 1992 to 1995. While resident at a stopover, individuals were very localized in their movements. Over 40{\%} of the birds made no inter-wetland movements, and over 90{\%} of individuals moved less than 10 km from their original release site. Characteristics of wetlands where birds were released did not affect bird movements. However, the structure of the surrounding landscape explained up to 46{\%} of variation in individual bird movements. As the distance between wetlands decreased, and the proportion of the landscape composed of wetlands increased, individual birds moved between wetlands more frequently and moved longer distances from their release site. These movement patterns indicate that a more connected landscape allows shorebirds to exploit more feeding sites with reduced searching costs; a result consistent with foraging theory. We estimate a degree of landscape connectivity at which a wetland complex functions as a single large wetland as measured by sandpiper feeding patterns. Our data provide support for the idea that complexes of small, closely spaced wetlands can be important migration stopovers and may have significant conservation value.},

abstract = {Partial migration is often considered a transitory stage between migration and residency, and whether partial migrants take weather conditions into account during migration is largely unknown. To assess whether partial migrants differ from regular migrants in their responses to weather, we compared the migratory intensity of a partial migrant, the Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus), with more regular migrants in relation to weather at a migratory passage site in southern Sweden (Falsterbo) during the years 1993-2002. The regular migrants in the study were Linnet (Carduelis cannabina), Common Chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs), Brambling (F. montifringilla), and European Robin (Erithacus rubecula). The Blue Tit differed from the regular migrants mainly in showing a striking negative correlation between migratory activity and cloud cover. Also, weather had the highest explanatory power for migratory intensity in the Blue Tit. This suggests that the Blue Tit is more sensitive to weather conditions on migration than the regular migrants and that it preferably awaits days with wholly or partly clear skies before migrating past Falsterbo. As a consequence, Blue Tits usually restrict their migratory flights to the safest occasions, with relatively calm weather, good visibility, and all orientation cues (solar as well as magnetic) available},

abstract = {1. Numerous studies have shown that, at spatial scales of metres to several kilometres, ani-mals balance the trade-off between foraging success and predation mortality by increasing their use of safer but less profitable habitats as predation risk increases. However, it is less clear whether prey respond similarly at the larger spatiotemporal scales of many ecosystems. 2. We determine whether this behaviour is evident in a large marine ecosystem, the southernGulf of St. Lawrence (sGSL, 75 000 km2 ) over a 42-year period. This ecosystem is character-ized by a recent increase in the abundance of a large marine predator, the grey seal ( Halichoe-rus grypus Fabricius), by more than an order of magnitude. 3.We compared changes in spatial distribution over the 1971– 2012 period between important prey of grey seals (Atlantic cod,Gadus morhuaL.; white hake,Urophycis tenuis Mitchill; and thorny skate,Amblyraja radiata Donovan) and non-prey fishes. Distribution was modelled using generalized additive models incorporating spatially variable effects of predation risk, density dependence and water temperature. 4. Distributions of cod, hake and skate were strongly related to risk of predation by seals, with distribution shifting into lower risk areas as predation risk increased. Non-prey species did not show similar changes in habitat use. Spatial variation in fish condition suggests that these low-risk areas are also less profitable for cod and skate in terms of food availability. The effects of density dependence and water temperature were also important in models, but did not account for the changes in habitat use as the risk of predation increased. 5. These results indicate that these fish are able to assess and respond to spatial variation in predation risk at very large spatial scales. They also suggest that non-consumptive ‘risk' effects may be an important component of the declines in productivity of seal prey in this ecosystem, and of the indirect effects at lower trophic levels.},

Secondary objectives were to determine whether buckthorn abundance in gaps is related to gap size, and whether or not buckthorn exhibits advanced regeneration. The abundance of glossy buckthorn was estimated in five patch cuts and three single-tree cuts in a 90 year old eastern hemlock-eastern white pine-sweet birch forest at the Woodman Horticultural Farm in Durham, NH, USA. Glossy buckthorn was 96 times more abundant in logged areas than in uncut control plots. The three largest but youngest gaps 0.08 ha; 5 years old) had the greatest proportion of tall 2 m), reproductively mature glossy buckthorn individuals, with 18.4{\%} fruiting. The older, medium-sized gaps (ca. 0.03 ha; 10 years old) contained the highest overall densities of glossy buckthorn, but few stems were flowering (similar to 2{\%}) and none were fruiting at the time of sampling. Small gaps 0.01 ha; 10 years old) appeared to be sinks for glossy buckthorn, as all individuals were 4 years old. As age and size of gaps were correlated, it was difficult to determine which factor played a larger role in the establishment and persistence of glossy buckthorn. However, the greater proportion of individuals {\textgreater} 2 m tall and greater reproductive vigor of glossy buckthorn in large gaps relative to small gaps-despite fewer years available for growth-suggest that larger disturbances lead to more resources available for buckthorn growth, survival, and reproduction. Individuals {\textless} 0.5 m tall were observed in uncut control plots at low density 30 stems/ha) and 5{\%} of stems in large gaps were older than the gaps themselves, suggesting that gap formation released previously established glossy buckthorn individuals (i.e., advanced regeneration).},

The behaviour of these models is greatly affected by the way in which transmission between infected and susceptible hosts is modelled. Since host-pathogen models were first developed at the beginning of the 20th century, the 'mass action' assumption has almost always been used for transmission.

abstract = {We describe the timing and location of the prebasic molt in the Ash-throated Flycatcher (Myiarchus cinerascens), a hawking insectivore with resident populations in Mexico and migrant populations that breed in the western United States. The timing of fall molt with respect to migration is of particular interest for Ash-throated Flycatchers from the United States because they breed in arid lowland habitats that are probably unproductive in late summer, and because time constraints on molt might force northern populations to leave their breeding grounds before molting. Adults and juveniles depart their breeding grounds to arrive and molt in the region of the Mexican monsoon shortly after the monsoon rains begin. Diminishing food on the breeding grounds and increasing food in the monsoon region seem more important than time constraints for explaining molt-related movements by northern populations, because more southerly breeding birds east and west of the monsoon region also move to the monsoon region to molt. We found age class differences in the timing and duration of molt. In adults the primary molt starts approximately 14 July and requires 76 days to complete, whereas in juveniles, primary molt starts approximately 1 August (18 days after adults) but requires only 50 days to complete. We found no evidence that juveniles molt more primaries simultaneously than adults, so we conclude that the daily growth rate of individual feathers must be higher in juveniles than adults.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a growing consensus that events during one part of an animal's annual cycle can detrimentally affect its future fitness. Notably, migratory species have been shown to commonly display such carry-over effects, facing severe time constraints and physiological stresses that can influence events across seasons. However, to date, no study has examined a full annual cycle to determine when these carry-over effects arise and how long they persist within and across years. Understanding when carry-over effects are created and how they persist is critical to identifying those periods and geographic locations that constrain the annual cycle of a population and determining how selection is acting upon individuals throughout the entire year. Using three consecutive years of migration tracks and four consecutive years of breeding success data, we tested whether carry-over effects in the form of timing deviations during one migratory segment of the annual cycle represent fitness costs that persist or accumulate across the annual cycle for a long-distance migratory bird, the Hudsonian godwit, Limosa haemastica. We found that individual godwits could migrate progressively later than population mean over the course of an entire migration period, especially southbound migration, but that these deviations did not accumulate across the entire year and were not consistently detected among individuals across years. Furthermore, neither the accumulation of lateness during previous portions of the annual cycle nor arrival date at the breeding grounds resulted in individuals suffering reductions in their breeding success or survival. Given their extreme life history, such a lack of carry-over effects suggests that strong selection exists on godwits at each stage of the annual cycle and that carry-over effects may not be able to persist in such a system, but also emphasizes that high-quality stopover and wintering sites are critical to the maintenance of long-distance migratory populations.},

We studied lifetime arrival patterns in the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica L.) in relation to variation in ecological conditions, as reflected by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the Sub-Saharan winter quarters and at stopover sites in North Africa. 2. Migratory birds have recently advanced their arrival dates, but the relative role of microevolution and phenotypic plasticity as mechanisms of response to changing environmental conditions remains unknown. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we investigated the change in the arrival date using cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. 3. We predicted that the effect (i.e. slopes) of environmental conditions in stopover or winter areas on arrival date should be similar using cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses in case phenotypic plasticity is the underlying mechanism, or they should differ in case microevolution is the mechanism. 4. As expected according to a previous cross-sectional study, we found an advance in the arrival date when ecological conditions improve in stopover areas and a delay in the arrival date when ecological conditions improve in the winter quarters. 5. Change in the arrival time at the breeding grounds due to ecological conditions found en route and, in the winter areas, was mainly due to phenotypic plasticity as shown by similarities in the slopes found in these relationships using cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. 6. We also investigated sex and age of barns swallows as sources of variation in the arrival time with respect to conditions experienced in winter and stopover areas. We found that earlier arrival at the breeding grounds due to prevailing ecological conditions found en route in North Africa was similar for males and females of all age-classes. In contrast, individuals tended to delay departure when ecological conditions improved in the winter quarters, but this delay differed among age classes, with old individuals delaying departure more than middle-aged and yearling birds. 7. The migratory response of individuals to changing climatic conditions experienced during different parts of their life provides evidence for individuals responding differently to prevailing conditions in the winter quarters depending on their age, but not to conditions experienced en route during spring migration.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT. Climate change can cause mismatches between the breeding phenology and peak abundance of food resources of migratory species. Moreover, asynchronously changing climate regimes across their ranges may constrain the ability of migratory species to adapt to all the regimes they encounter. To understand the potential effect of asynchronous changes, I examined the influences of both large- and local-scale weather and climate on the timing of arrival of two disjunct breeding populations of Hudsonian Godwits (Limosa haemastica). I used arrival data from two study sites—Beluga River, Alaska, and Churchill, Manitoba—combined with 37 years of weather and climate data from both winter and stopover sites and the breeding grounds. The Alaskan population now arrives ∼9 days earlier than it did in the early 1970s, and the Churchill population arrives {\textgreater}10 days later. A model-selection process using linear regression models suggested that these divergent trends result from different suites of environmental facto...},

abstract = {We use an individual-based model to assess the conservation objectives for knot Calidris canutus L and oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus L on the Burry Inlet Special Protection Area (SPA), UK. Population monitoring has identified a decline in oystercatcher numbers, but cannot determine whether this is due to a decline in site quality. Long term data on cockle stocks show that the biomass of the large-sized cockles consumed by oystercatcher declined after 2004, whereas a similar decline was not observed in the smaller cockles consumed by knot. The model postdicts that during the winters of 2005/2006 to 2008/2009 the site was unable to support the number of oystercatcher present at the time it was designated (i.e. the SPA population). Large cockle biomass remained low during 2009/2010, but increases in mussel biomass meant that the model postdicted that the site could support the SPA population of oystercatcher. Knot food supplies remained high during most years, except 2008/2009 during which the model postdicted that the SPA population could not be supported. The model postdicted that the stock reserved for oystercatchers after shellfishing needed to be 2-4 times the amount consumed by the birds in order to support the bird population. We recommend that where necessary, the conservation objectives of waterbirds should be assessed using a combination of thorough population size and behaviour monitoring to identify sites with population declines, and individual-based modelling on these sites to determine whether reduction in site quality may contribute to the site-specific population decline.

@article{lank_effects_2003,
abstract = {We examine the potential selective importance of predation danger on the evolution of migration strategies of arctic-breeding calidrid sandpipers. Adult calidrids truncate parental care for reasons not obviously related to levels of food abundance on the breeding areas or at migratory stopover sites, suggesting that a different trade-off occurs between providing additional care and adult survivorship. The southward migrations of adult western sandpipers precede those of migratory peregrine falcons by almost a month. By moving early and quickly, adults remain ahead of migrant falcons all the way to their non-breeding areas, where they rapidly moult flight feathers. They complete the moult just as falcons arrive in late September-October. By migrating early, they avoid exposure to falcons when they are unusually vulnerable, due to the requirements for fuelling migratory flight and of wing feather moult. Juvenile western sandpipers migrate south just as falcon numbers start to increase, but do not moult flight feathers in their first winter. Pacific dunlin use an alternative strategy of remaining and moulting in Alaska after falcons depart, and migrating to their overwintering sites after migrants have passed. East of the Rocky Mountains, the southbound migration of falcons begins 4-6 weeks later. Southbound semipalmated sandpipers make extended migratory stopovers, but their lengths of stay shorten prior to falcon migration to the sites in September. Predation danger also may affect the evolution of migration routes. Southbound western sandpipers fly directly from Alaska to southern British Columbia, in contrast to the multi-stage journey northward along the Alaska panhandle. We estimate that a direct flight would be more economical on northward migration, but may be avoided because it would expose sandpipers to higher mass-dependent predation danger from migratory falcons, which travel north with sandpipers. By contrast, few raptors are present in Alaska during preparation for the southward flight. A temporal and spatial window of safety may also permit semipalmated sandpipers to become extremely vulnerable while preparing for trans-Atlantic southward flights. Danger management may account for the these previously enigmatic features of calidrid migration strategies, and aspects of those of other birds.},

abstract = {The faunal communities of four intertidal habitats namely sand, mud, seagrass (Zostera noltii) and seagrass patches (mixSM) of a temperate coastal lagoon, Ria Formosa (southern Portugal), were sampled. A total of 47 species were taken in 428 bottomless drop sampler samples, with the highest number of species and the more commonly occurring species belonging to the Mollusca phylum. The dominance of these gastropod species underlines the importance of the grazing food chain in these habitats. Bittium reticulatum was the most abundant species, being especially abundant in the seagrass habitat. The most frequent and highest biomass species in the community was Carcinus maenas, a predator that makes use of the available resources and that is adapted to the highly variable intertidal environment. Pomatoschistus microps was the most abundant fish species, with highest densities in the mud habitat, which demonstrates an ability to occupy a low depth area. The seagrass; habitat had the highest diversity, abundance and biomass, followed by the mixSM habitat and was different from all the others. Assemblages were highly influenced by the presence of vegetation, providing forage and refuge from predation. A well defined summer group was identified in all habitats. These results highlight the importance of seagrass beds and the idea that their decrease implies the decrease of lagoon production through the impoverishment of the trophic structure of the lagoon.

Here, we review the literature to disentangle the actions of evolutionary changes in response to selection induced by climate change versus changes due to individual plasticity, that is, the capacity of an individual to adjust its phenology to environmental variables. Within the abundant literature on climate change effects on bird phenology, only a small fraction of studies are based on individual data, yet individual data are required to quantify the relative importance of plastic versus evolutionary responses. While plasticity seems common and often adaptive, no study so far has provided direct evidence for an evolutionary response of bird phenology to current climate change. This assessment leads us to notice the alarming lack of tests for microevolutionary changes in bird phenology in response to climate change, in contrast with the abundant claims on this issue. In short, at present we cannot draw reliable conclusions on the processes underlying the observed patterns of advanced phenology in birds. Rapid improvements in techniques for gathering and analysing individual data offer exciting possibilities that should encourage research activity to fill this knowledge gap.},

An additional eleven years of data was assessed to determine if declines were ongoing. Analysis (Pearson correlation) of the Quebec Checklist data indicated a significant decline overall, from 1976 to 2008, and the percentage of checklists reporting flocks of {\textgreater}1,000 birds has decreased significantly since the 1970s. New analyses of population trends with migration monitoring data from eastern and central North America were conducted for the 35-year period from 1974 to 2009, using program ESTEQNINDEXE. Trends, although generally negative, were not statistically significant. In the North Atlantic region, where survey sites had the highest counts of Semipalmated Sandpipers, average abundance indices showed a pronounced decrease between 1985 and 1999 and an increase since then. Although the trend was not statistically significant, declines in Ontario amounted to an estimated 8{\%} per year from 1974 to 2009. Counts were variable for Semipalmated Sandpipers in the Midcontinent region, although average abundance indices appeared lower in the second half of the analysis period (1989-2009). Thus, the population status of Semipalmated Sandpipers in North America may have improved since the 1990s, at least in the east. Received 8 July 2011, accepted 2 December 2011.},

abstract = {Climate projections for the Midwestern United States predict southerly climates to shift northward. These shifts in climate could alter distributions of species across North America through changes in climate (i.e., temperature and precipitation), or through climate-induced changes on land cover. Our objective was to determine the relative impacts of land cover and climate on the abundance of five bird species in the Central United States that have habitat requirements ranging from grassland and shrubland to forest. We substituted space for time to examine potential impacts of a changing climate by assessing climate and land cover relationships over a broad latitudinal gradient. We found positive and negative relationships of climate and land cover factors with avian abundances. Habitat variables drove patterns of abundance in migratory and resident species, although climate was also influential in predicting abundance for some species occupying more open habitat (i.e., prairie warbler, blue-winged warbler, and northern bobwhite). Abundance of northern bobwhite increased with winter temperature and was the species exhibiting the most significant effect of climate. Models for birds primarily occupying early successional habitats performed better with a combination of habitat and climate variables whereas models of species found in contiguous forest performed best with land cover alone. These varied species-specific responses present unique challenges to land managers trying to balance species conservation over a variety of land covers. Management activities focused on increasing forest cover may play a role in mitigating effects of future climate by providing habitat refugia to species vulnerable to projected changes. Conservation efforts would be best served focusing on areas with high species abundances and an array of habitats. Future work managing forests for resilience and resistance to climate change could benefit species already susceptible to climate impacts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {We examine the trade-off between gathering food and avoiding predation in the context of patch use by a group of animals. Often a forager will have to choose between feeding sites that differ in both energetic gain rate and predation risk. The ideal site will have a high gain rate and low risk of predation. However, intake rate will often decrease when the patch is shared with other foragers and it may be optimal for some individuals to feed elsewhere. Within the framework of ideal free theory, we investigate the distribution of foragers that will equalise individual fitness gains. We focus on a two- patch environment with continuous inputs of food. With reference to existing experimental studies, we examine the effects of risk dilution, food input rates and an animal's expectations of the future. We identify the effect of total animal numbers when one patch is subject to predation risk and the other is safe. Conditions under which the difference in intake rate in the two patches is constant are identified, as are conditions in which the ratio of animals in the two patches is constant, If current conditions do not alter future expectations an increase in input rates to the patches promotes increased use of the risky patch. Yet, if conditions are assumed to persist indefinitely the opposite effect is seen. When both patches are subject to predation risk, dilution of risk favours more extreme distributions, and may lead to more than one stable distribution. The results of these models are used to critically analyse previous work on the energetic equivalence of risk. This paper is intended to help guide the development of new experimental studies into the energy-risk trade-off.},

abstract = {Metapopulation models are widely used to study species that occupy patchily distributed habitat, but are rarely applied to migratory species, because of the difficulty of identifying demographically independent subpopulations. Here, we extend metapopulation theory to describe the directed seasonal movement of migratory populations between two sets of habitat patches, breeding and non-breeding, with potentially different colonization and extinction rates between patch types. By extending the classic metapopulation model, we show that migratory metapopulations will persist if the product of the two colonization rates exceeds the product of extinction rates. Further, we develop a spatially realistic migratory metapopulation model and derive a landscape metric—the migratory metapopulation capacity—that determines persistence. This new extension to metapopulation theory introduces an important tool for the management and conservation of migratory species and may also be applicable to model the dynamics of two host–parasite systems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity are expected to increase the extinction risk of small populations, but detailed tests in natural populations are scarce. We combine long-term population and fitness data with those from two types of molecular markers to examine the role of genetic effects in a declining metapopulation of southern dunlins Calidris alpina schinzii, an endangered shorebird. RESULTS: The decline is associated with increased pairings between related individuals, including close inbreeding (as revealed by both field observations of parentage and molecular markers). Furthermore, reduced genetic diversity seems to affect individual fitness at several life stages. Higher genetic similarity between mates correlates negatively with the pair's hatching success. Moreover, offspring produced by related parents are more homozygous and suffer from increased mortality during embryonic development and possibly also after hatching. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate strong genetic effects in a rapidly declining population, emphasizing the importance of genetic factors for the persistence of small populations.},

abstract = {Dunlin (Calidris alpina) scanning and flocking behavior was studied in two habitats with different predation risk. Mean flock size, time spent scanning, and mean scan duration were higher in rice fields (dhe less profitable and high-risk habitat) than in littoral habitats (the more profitable and low-risk habitat), although vigilance rate was not different between habitats. Increased scanning and flocking behavior probably increase efficency in predator avoidance. The results are explained as behavioral changes to ensure safety in a high predation-risk situation when starvation risk is also present.},

@article{Cooper2015,
abstract = {Many tropical habitats experience pronounced dry seasons, during which arthropod food availability declines, potentially limiting resident and migratory animal populations. In response to declines in food, individuals may attempt to alter their space use to enhance access to food resources, but may be socially constrained from doing so by con- and heterospecifics. If social constraints exist, food declines should result in decreased body condition. In migratory birds, correlational evidence suggests a link between body condition and migration timing. Poor body condition and delayed migration may, in turn, impact fitness in subsequent seasons via carry-over effects. To determine if winter food availability affects space use, inter- and intraspecific competition, body composition (i.e., mass, fat, and pectoral muscle), and migration timing, we experimentally decreased food availability on individual American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla) territories in high-quality mangrove habitat. Redstarts on control territories experienced {\~{}}40{\%} loss of food due to the seasonal nature of the environment. Redstarts on experimental territories experienced {\~{}}80{\%} declines in food, which closely mimicked natural declines in nearby, low-quality, scrub habitat. Individuals on food-reduced territories did not expand their territories locally, but instead either became non-territorial ?floaters? or remained on territory. Regardless of territorial status, food-reduced American Redstarts all deposited fat compared to control birds. Fat deposits provide insurance against the risk of starvation, but, for American Redstarts, came at the expense of maintaining pectoral muscle. Subsequently, food-reduced American Redstarts experienced, on average, a one-week delay in departure on spring migration, likely due to the loss of pectoral muscle. Thus, our results demonstrate experimentally, for the first time, that declines in winter food availability can result in a fat?muscle trade-off, which, in turn, delays departure on spring migration. Previous work has demonstrated that, for each day delayed after the first male arrival on the breeding grounds, American Redstarts experience an 11{\%} decrease in the chance of successfully reproducing. Therefore, such delays in departure likely lead to fitness costs for migratory birds. Because tropical seasonal forests are expected to become drier in response to global climate change, Neotropical migratory bird populations may experience significant winter food limitation, further exacerbating population declines in the coming decades.},

abstract = {Understanding the forces driving population dynamics is critical for species conservation and population management. For migratory birds, factors that regulate population abundance could come from effects experienced on breeding areas, wintering grounds, or during migration. We compiled survey data for Pacific and Atlantic subspecies of dunlins (Calidris alpina pacifica and C. a. hudsonica) from range-wide Christmas bird counts (1975–2010), and investigated the influences on this population index of density-dependence, falcon numbers, a set of seasonal environmental conditions during breeding, migration and non-breeding periods, and large-scale meteorological measures. For both sub-species, numbers fluctuated irregularly, varying threefold over the survey period, with no long-term upward or downward trend. Based on Royama's general model framework, the change in numbers between successive years for both sub-species was negatively affected by the total count in the previous year (i.e., negative density-dependence) and by the eastward component of storm movement during fall migration, with slower motion associated with higher population growth. The remaining environmental factors differed between the sub-species (snowmelt date on the Pacific, temperature on the Atlantic) or acted in opposite directions (soil moisture). The directional effects of each of these factors are consistent with the biology of dunlin, and together they explain 67.4 (72.9 {\%}) of the variation in the rate of change of Pacific (Atlantic) dunlin annual counts. Falcon numbers were not predictive, despite a tenfold increase in abundance, suggesting compensatory mortality. This study highlights directions for future studies, and provides a model for the analysis of other migratory species.},
