91		"The time span for the survey was 1400 - 1630 at 15 minute intervals. This makes 11 counts. The data entry form only allows 9 counts to be entered, therefore potentially missing counts when birds maybe closest and easiest to count.

As a result, I have not been able to enter my 1615 and 1630 counts. These are, however, also 0 counts, but there is some WESA activity to note.

Estimating the tideline position is very difficult. The tide is so far out at the beginning of the count period (1km+) that it's pure guesswork.

In addition, even with a scope, peeps at that range would be very difficult to identify. Compounding this problem is that the mudflats were very hazy with lots of shimmer on Saturday. This is a common condition with this location at this time of day and season.

Given the extreme distance of the tide, and the haze and shimmer at this location, I suggest that I start the Sunday count at 15:30, instead of 14:30 and go to 17:00. Prior to that time, peeps would only be identifiable and easily counted by walking out on the mudflats. This of course would violate the stationary protocol."			5	Spotting scope				Motorcycle ridden on mudflats from 1530 to 1630	"1697 to 1702 1400hrs

92		It was a challenging site because most of the time the sandpipers were very distant. At the very end of the survey period, I got lucky and had a single sandpiper in very close to me (10m or so). Otherwise, I could only see the sandpipers when they were airborne. Even my spotting scope was not powerful enough at such great range to make them visible.			2	Spotting scope				"Small planes: 5

311	Collaborative	For this site, the ponds are best from about a 6ft tide rising to a 10ft tide measured from the Everett tide table.  The extensive mud flats are completely covered at about 7ft.  This pushes the all the shore birds onto the ponds to feed and the falcons follow.  the specified time slot was about 2 hrs too early.	7/18	18		Both Binoculars and Scope	7	No activity						None				EIDE2014718	Calm	Eide Rd	EIDE		Online		mid ~ 5 ft	low ~ 3ft	Mid-low	Low-tide	18:30:00	16:00:00				1km		Partly-Cloudy	I did not observe any Western Sandpipers during the entire survey

327	Independent 	"It was only when birds were at closest point 200m that positive identifications could be made, and then not every individual.

At this location and throughout Boundary Bay LESA tend to be mostly separate from WESA because they forage higher up the beach in slightly drier habitats.

Earlier this week I had some very close looks at a flock of about 1000 peeps at 112th. Mixed in with the majority WESA were a number of Semipalmated Sandpipers, perhaps 1%, visible only with close scrutiny. The LESA seen that day were in small, single species flocks feeding slightly higher up the beach.

In the large flocks of peeps seen on July 20 there could have been numbers of SESA's mixed in, but they were not separable under the viewing conditions. Other birders in the area reported ""good numbers"" of SESA in the WESA flocks.

Regarding maps. The small maps supplied this time I found too difficult to use. Instead I used the air photo to mark the flock locations."	7/20	20		Both Binoculars and Scope	7	No activity							0 LESA:>5000 WESA/peeps			BB722014720	Rippled	Boundary Bay - 72nd	BB72		Online		high tide	mid low 	High-tide	Mid-low	14:30:00	12:15:00		Weather	Visibility varied due to squalls moving through	1km		Overcast	I saw at least 1 WESA during the survey

The position of the water along the shore changed less than 1 m during the whole period. A shallow sandbar may have become more exposed later in the survey period near the Colwood Cr mouth, but it was not used much.
Some of the WESA were quite high in the intertidal, near the grasses. Even though the beach was quite rocky, they seemed to foraging between the stones.
We are quite confident that the ""peeps"" were all WESA because it appeared that the same flock was moving around the area (although not all visible at each count) and we could see that they were WESA when they were close. However, we recorded them as peeps when they were too far to confirm id.
A small separate flock of LESA was noted separately in the comments section."	7/19	19		Both Binoculars and Scope	7			"Walkers were only included if they were near the shore; none were actually on the beach.

The Google map was good visually but the other map was confusing and appeared inaccurate.  For this area suggest planning the count closer to the high tide due to the rocky shore, there is more activity once the water has covered all the rocks. 	8/16	16	19	Both Binoculars and Scope	8			Salmon fishing is very good right now, seemed like non stop boats entering and leaving Sooke Harbour	to follow	33.0		None	5 WESA 2 LESA			WHIF2014816	Rippled	Whiffin Spit Park	WHIF		Online		14 meters	15 meters	Mid-tide	Mid-low	14:30:00	12:00:00	3	Weather	Foggy in the distance	500m	84	Overcast	I saw at least 1 WESA during the survey

Waiting for the tide to push them in, would not have been sufficient. I moved 25 metres closer to the parking lot, from the arranged spot, due to uneven terrain. This applied to all Wesa and Lesa counts seen on the ground. I recommend the site be moved to this location.		15		Both Binoculars and Scope	8			21 Clam diggers.

The first day when I got the bird count would have been the best time to get closer for a ID shot or use binocs. But didn't wish to disturb them more. Unfortunately did not get a better chance then here. On 16th & 17th the birds were most of the times well spread out. Did walk closer to ID the birds. Did spot a couple of LESA.

1088	Single Observer	"For the last few months there's been a construction fence up near the Royal Roads dock (survey location) that impedes views along the beach at the site. 

I've regularly bird at the Selkirk Trestle/Cecelia Creek in the Gorge Waterway in Victoria. It might be worth adding this site as it seems to have greater sandpiper use than does the Royal Roads side of Esquimalt Lagoon.

1104	Collaborative	Note that tide level in lagoon does not change much when sea level is below lagoon level as it was for the entire period (water is entering from a stream and exiting via the outlet the whole time). The distance from shore to water edge is relatively constant, but the magnitude varies along the shoreline. At first during the count period, there was quite a bit of flying and settling briefly, but we could not see any threats or disturbances. Because of the location of the flocks, it was not possible to get a closer look to try to estimate the ratio of WESA to LESA after the count. On July 25 after a beached bird survey (about 09:00), I scanned the area where P1 and P2 had been seen. There was a small flock (16) at P2 and 2 more right on the shore. The two on the shore were LESA and all that I could identify in the flock of 16 also appeared to be LESA. After this I walked around the lagoon trails and did a count in the upper lagoon, more relevant to the counts of July 23 (notes will be added there).	2017-07-22 00:00:00	22.0	0	Both Binoculars and Scope	7.0					0.0		None				WITT2017722	Calm		WITT	Wittys Lagoon	Online		Low	Low	Low-tide	Low-tide	11:30:00	09:00:00	0.0			500m	3	Overcast	I saw at least 1 WESA during the survey

1124	Independent 	"Oops, I missed entering my 9:15 observation. So entered it out of order rather than going back and re-entering everything. Note that the merlin observation is outside of the survey period. I stayed on birding at the site so saw it later. 

As noted in July, this observation point is currently not ideal for surveying. A construction fence is blocking the part of the beach where the mudflats are exposed so watching for birds involves a lot of walking back and forth so as not to miss things. Still, I'm confident that these observations are a good representation of local shorebird activity. Likely the same tiny flock of WESA & LESA all morning.
